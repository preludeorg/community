name: Install PowerShell Core 6
description: |
  PowerShell is installed by default on Windows computers. It is often abused by hackers, so it is usually heavily
  monitored by security products. There is a separate open-source project called PowerShell Core which is not monitored.
  This procedure downloads, installs and restarts a PowerShell agent under PowerShell Core.
