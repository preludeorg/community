name: Check for virtualization environment
description: |
  Malware can use various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and sandbox environments. 
  They do this by searching, in results of the system checks, for presence of any artifacts that may indicate that the system is a virtual or sandbox environment.
  This procedure will use WMI to query information on the physical disk drive and then search for VM artifacts.
