### A hacker's perspective

---

When your computer first connects to a Local Area Network (LAN), it does not have an IP address. It has to connectto the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to get an IP address. To do so, your computer has toperform a broadcast to a special Broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255 which essentially means every machine on theLAN will receive your request for an IP address. The DHCP server will then respond with an IP address to be assignedto your machine. Broadcasting also allows the machines on a network to auto discover services being offered by variousmachines on the network. If I am connected to a network - and know the broadcast IP - I can attempt several attacks,related to "spoofing".

### Expected output

---

A single ip address (ip.T1016) should be in the console, showing where the router exists on the network.

### Basic variations

---

Every computer system has utilities that allow for quickly looking up local network configurations, such as ifconfigon *nix systems. These utilities can include the broadcast IP address, the local IP address and more. External tools,such as WireShark and netstat can be used to look this information up but that would be overkill in most situations.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Because of the vast number of packets sent across a local network, discovering hosts, handshaking, etc, there isno suitable detection for this procedure.

### How it is chained

---

The most likely procedure to follow this one would be around spoofing an IP address on the local network (T1134.004). If anadversary can make other computers in the network think their machine is, say the router, they can redirecttraffic through their compromised machine as a "man-in-the-middle" attack. There are many variations of spoofingthat will be covered in other courses.
