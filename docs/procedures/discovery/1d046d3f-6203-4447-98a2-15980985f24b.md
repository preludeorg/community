### Malicious use of administrative tools

Many organizations have issues detecting the malicious use of administrative tools. The primary reason for this isdue to the lack of proper user group management and enforcement. Ensuring that all regular users belong to the proper group while requiring administrative tasks to take place on an administrative account can greatly increase the likelihood of detection. Setting a SIEM alert to notify of when a user outside of the administrator groupuses an administrative tool can give you insight into malicious uses or even highlight shortfalls in user group management.
