### A hacker's perspective

---

Understanding the layout of a domain is critical to making decisions on what systems to target and where to maneuverin order to achieve my objectives. This AdFind query allows me to poll the Active Directory server for trusted domainobjects (TDOs) for the current forest. Often, large corporations will have multiple forests and sub-domains as part of a network segmentationstrategy or even have trust relationships with third-party companies (see the Target data breach in 2013). I canleverage trusts to potentially pivot into more secure areas of a target networks or persist less secure/less defendedareas of the target network.

### Expected output

---

Text file (file.T1482) containing details on the Trusted Domain Objects that exist on this Active Directory domain.

### Basic variations

---

Adfind combines the features of several other situational awareness tools (like ldapsearch and dsquery) into a singlepowerful tool. Built-in PowerShell tools can be used to achieve the exact same objective using commands like:`Get-ADObject –SearchBase "cn=interal,dc=malicious,dc=com" –Filter * -Properties trustType | where {$_.objectClass –eq"trustedDomain"} | select Name,trustTypeThere`, which will similarly grab the TDOs for the target domain. Adversarieswill use many variants of this command to find the trust they might be able to leverage.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Unfortunately, this tool (and the others in this category) largely leverage normal system and network discovery methodsused for legitimate traffic on networks. To block this specific ability, look for usage of AdFind by monitoring commandline and PowerShell script blocks. Ideally use A/V or EDR solutions to block the hash of the AdFind executable, which wouldprovide some protection against "script kiddie" attackers. Well designed networks with good segmentation can help limitthe amount of information a single endpoint can query about the larger network structure.

### How it is chained

---

Trust discovery is part of an adversary's active remote reconnaisance on a target network. Once they have discovereda trust, it will lead to additional remote system discovery (T1018) and possible network service scanning (T1046) ofservices on that newly discovered trusted domain/forest. Depending on the type of TDO that is discovered an adversarymight look to pivot into another area of the network by leveraging shared and/or trusted resources like SMB/Windowsadmin shares (T1021.002)
