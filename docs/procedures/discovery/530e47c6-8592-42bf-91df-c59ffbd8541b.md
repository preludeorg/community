### A hacker's perspective

Windows hides directories ending with $, which indicate an admin share directory. These directories are used tohost files useful for remote management. Think of these as a USB drive every computer in the network can access.Understanding where these drives are located and getting a list of files on them is super important - as this isgenerally where I'll find network maps, plain-text passwords, infrastructre-as-code details (Ansible/Terraform)and more valuable data. Because these directories are hidden by default, most sysadmins do not lock them down.

### Expected output

The absolute directory path (directory.T1135) to any found admin drives will print to console.

### Basic variations

Viewing admin shares is the same as viewing any other directory, you can do it from a command line or from afile window, assumming GUI access. Checking the Server Message Block (SMB) is a common variation because SMB is aprotocol which sits right on top of the Windows file system.

### Prevent + Detect

Like many other discovery techniques, this procedure is tough to detect. However, one good detection technique isto detect any time a non-administrator accesses a shared drive ending in $. This would typically indicate someoneup to no good - insider threat or adversary. A better solution entirely is to ensure nothing of value is stored onthese shared drives.

### How it is chained

Immediately following the collection of shared drives, an adversary is likely to copy the entire directoryto a staged directory for exfiltration (T1074). Alternatively, the adversary may open each file and determine which onesare of value and which are not (T1083). Depending on the file extensions in the directory, they are likely to use a toollike grep to search for keywords in the files.
