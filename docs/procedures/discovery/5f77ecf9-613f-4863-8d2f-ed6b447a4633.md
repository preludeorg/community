### A hacker's perspective

---

I look at the known hosts file to see which remote computers have been connected to. If this file exists at all,it tells me I'm on a technical person's computer, such as  a systems administrator or a software engineer. If thefile is there, I can then extract all of the IP addresses and FQDNs in order to draw a network map of what thisuser has access to. This information will allow me to move laterally, which is my tactical goal for running thisprocedure.

### Expected output

---

The full contents of the known hosts file will print to console, containing ip addresses and host keys.

### Basic variations

---

None.

### Prevent + Detect

---

None.

### How it is chained

---

After running this command, an adversary may attempt one of a few SSH variations (T1098.004): look at the~/.ssh/config file for actual, saved SSH commands matching the hosts found, SSH to each host in the known_host files,using the default ~/.ssh/id_rsa private key.
