### A hacker's perspective

---

This is a big one - and one of the first techniques I execute when I compromise a system. Understanding thesecurity on a computer (in general) will automatically help me understand what will and won't work. Understandingcommon defensive solutions is helpful, so I can make these decisions automatically, otherwise I need to pause andresearch what I find, which takes valuable time. When I execute this procedure, I learn what firewall productis installed the computer. I mainly use this information to know what type of agent communications are likely towork, such as UDP, TCP or HTTP callbacks.

### Expected output

---

None. This command will not output any usable standard out.

### Basic variations

---

There are a lot of ways to determine the firewall on a computer. Opening a terminal and executing a check like thisprocedure is one way, but it's likely more common (on Windows) to just open the Applications and view the installedprograms. Likewise, on Linux or MacOS you can just list (ls) the Applications directory and manually note if yousee a firewall product. Most of the time, if one exists, it is turned on.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Depending on how this procedure is executed, you can employ detection. If the user simply looks at installed/runningapps, no detection will be effective. However, if the user executes a "Get-WmiObject" PowerShell cmdlet, witha parameter (-Class) of AntiVirusProduct, there is a strong chance it is a malicious action. Even among systemadministrators, this would be a pretty rare occurence.

### How it is chained

---

Adversaries running this procedure will likely run similar procedures under this technique (T1518), to identifyother security measures, such as which antivirus is installed or if there are centralized logging agents runningon the computer. After executing this technique, any number of procedures could be in play.
