### A hacker's perspective

---

Finding opportunities to perform lateral movement is critical in propagating your attack throughout the network. One such method of identifying potential targets is through enumerating shared resources. Having accessed to a shared resource would make it possible to stage payloads and execute them on the host system.

### Expected output

---

Standard output containing the list of shared resource directories

### Basic variations

---

There are multiple variations to this TTP. Attackers can leverage the net view command from Powershell in order to programatically list shared folders, and users that access to the shared folders. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

Since this TTP is utilizing a system pre-installed application, it is hard to prevent. Detection, however is possible. Users can enable logging for Powershell and command line on their machine. Utilizing the log, detection rules can be built around this command.

### How it is chained

---

After obtaining a list of shared directories attackers will often enumerate through and drop payloads to repeat the process. This will allow them to move laterally through the network by performing credential access, collection and privilege escalation on the new host.
