### A hacker's perspective

Reading the Windows registry gives me a complete view on the configuration of the computer system, from localsettings to domain-generated ones. There are dozens of "important" registry keys which I may look for. In thismost simplistic case, I'm simply checking the registry for the Windows version of the computer. This key can beswapped out for any other key I may be interested in, and as you can see from this procedure, the registry key is avariable for this very reason. A sample registry key looks like: HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion.Keys are stored in "hives", which are like buckets. The most common hive is the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, oftenabbreviated as HKLM. This particular hive contains the majority of the configuration information for the softwareyou have installed, as well as for the Windows operating system itself.

### Expected output

The value of the given registry key will print to console.

### Basic variations

Look for two core variations of this procedure: an adversary swapping out which key(s) they're looking for and theway they're executing the query. An adversary may use a PowerShell cmdlet such as Get-ItemProperty or one of dozensof variations from shell code to a programming language on top of Windows System Internals. There are so manyvariations because many defensive tools, by default, throw warning flags when the registry is queried andadversaries are always looking for new ways to get around them.

### Prevent + Detect

You can play the cat-and-mouse game of coming up with every registry detection rule possible but adversaries arepersistent in this area. In practice, reading the registry is informational whereas updating the registrycan create significant security holes: so that's where most of your effort should go. However, there are a fewareas you can hone in on per detection: look for any references to HKLM or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the logs.

### How it is chained

The natural follow-up to this procedure is an attempt to modify one of the registry keys (T1112).
