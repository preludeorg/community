### A hacker's perspective

---

"who" is a classic "hello world" command. It simply returns the name of the active user, no more, no less. This procedure is often the very first one used post-compromise - because it's important (and curious!) to know exactly who you just hacked. It's important because in order to look for files owned by the active user or understand your session's permissions or locate your password or .. you name it: you need to know the username you just compromised first. 

### Expected output

---

A list of usernames which are currently logged into the computer will print to console. 

### Basic variations

---

The "who" command has a few aliases such as "w", which return the active user plus additional information. Also, most programming languages support a built-in command to access the active user. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

One "secret" for detection is to log and alert (lightly!) any time the traditional "who" command is executed from a command line, regardless of the operating system. Why? If you are the legit user of a computer, you don't need to look up your own name. Most cases of this procedure in the wild are malicious - or they're sysadmins who should not be doing something (i.e., they remote accesses someone else's machine). 

### How it is chained

---

This procedure is usually among the first commands executed by an adversary. There is no natural procedures which follow it but you can expect at some point the username will be referenced in upcoming procedures, such as listing all files in user-owed directories (T1083).
