### Metadata

This is a man page for a TTP available in Operator. Man pages provide additional context around procedures and should be consulted if you are looking to learn about a particular chain.

### A hacker's perspective

---

There are numerous proof-of-concept exploits available on the internet for various operating systems. For Windows, Microsoft typically pushes out those patches on "Patch Tuesday" which is the second Tuesday of each month. Occasionally there are certain vulnerabilities that require Out-of-Band cumulative updates; as an attacker I can watch those patches, track the KB numbers, and check systems for that particular patch. In the case of PrintNightmare, if a system is missing KB5004945 then we can try to exploit the location Printer Spooler to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM. 

### Expected output

---

If the KB is missing from the target system, you will get a JSON blob formatted as {"NotInstalled": "KB5004945"}. If the patch is installed, no output is generated. 

### Basic variations

---

This particular approach uses Component Object Model (COM) Objects to create an Update Searcher that can list all installed patches and updates. Other common techniques are using `Get-HotFix` and `wmic qfe list brief`; the downside of these variations however is that they use the Win32_QuickFixEngineering WMI class which doesn't return all of the updates. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

As with other simple (non-malicious) script blocks, it is difficult to detect and prevent these queries. Focus on other components of the adversary's kill chain that involve more explicitly malicious behavior. 

### How it is chained

---

An attacker looking at patch levels is hunting for potential exploitation paths for privilege escalation, credential access, and more. In the kill chain for PrintNightmare, this TTP is used to determine if a patch is missing. If the patch is missing, we ingress several payloads and install a malicious driver that launches rundll32 to start a Pneuma DLL (T1082|T1105|T1104|T1068) (T1012|T1105|T1104|T1068).
