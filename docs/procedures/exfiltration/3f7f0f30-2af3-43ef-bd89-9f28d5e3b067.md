### A hacker's perspective

---

After collecting valuable information, hackers want to exfiltrate their data to their C2 server. In order to avoid detection they will need to make the communication seemingly legitimate. Uploading artifacts to 3rd party cloud providers makes the connection seem legitimate.

### Expected output

---

HTTP response confirming upload of the file.

### Basic variations

---

Attackers can utilize other cloud providers such as Google Drive, OneDrive, MEGA, and 4shared.

### Prevent + Detect

---

If an endpoint is sending HTTP(S) requests to unapproved cloud services, they should be flagged. Abnormally large uploads should also be detected.

### How it is chained

---

This TTP is usually used at the end of the chain in order to obtain information. Attackers will laterally move and collect on more hosts to repeat this step.
