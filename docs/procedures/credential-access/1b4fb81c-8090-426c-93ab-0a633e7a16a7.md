### A hacker's perspective

"Sniffing traffic" means to look under the covers at the packets sent from your computer to other computers,whether in your network or over the internet. You've heard of SSL and this is where it becomes important (amongother encrypted traffic libraries for varying protocols). Generically speaking, SSL encrypts traffic enroute. If you're usingHTTP instead, this traffic is unencrypted, meaning you (or someone else in your network) may be able to "sniff" theunencrypted packets being sent from your computer. Let's say you're logging into an HTTP website portal. Your username and passwordwould be sent, unencrypted, from your laptop to the server. Anyone sniffing your traffic at the moment you click 'submit' mayget eyes on your plain-text credentials. Neat trick, right? Most operating systems have built-in utilities which can dothis sniffing, such as tcpdump (MacOS/Linux) and New-NetEventSession (Windows). This allows an attacker to sniff yourtraffic without needing to install a 3rd party library. Aside from credentials, sniffing traffic can also yield otherimportant pieces of information, whether the data is encrypted or not. An attacker may just be curious what other computersyours commmunicates with. They can see any website you're interfacing with and the timestamps of your web surfing behavior.One thing I look for, aside from credentials, are unsavory websites visited. These can be very useful in ransomware attacks,as you now have something "on" an individual.

### Expected output

A list of connections, each one containing at least one match on a username or password.

### Basic variations

Because network sniffing utilities are built into most operating systems, it makes sense for an attacker to leverage themvs installing a new one. However, there are many to choose from if installing. One of the most popular is a Python librarycalled scapy, which can be installed on most computers without root access, using just "pip install scapy". This libraryallows a hacker to programmatically write a script, interacting with the network packets, and may be more difficult todetect.

### Prevent + Detect

First, always use SSL. Most browsers will allow you to set SSL-always-on, ensuring that you cannot accidently browse toan HTTP website when an SSL one is available. Second, note that sniffers can run in either promiscuous or non-promiscuous mode,the former being the more powerful and therefore more common. Luckily, you can detect a promiscuous-mode sniffer pretty easily by keeping tabson your network interfaces. For example, on MacOS and Linux you can can simply search for "ifconfig -a" and look forany network interface with PROMISC in the flag. Lastly, sniffing libraries tend to be CPU-intensive, so look for computerswhich are spiking unusually in resources used. This might be an indication of a sniffer running.

### How it is chained

Network sniffing, specifically for credential access, would indicate that the hacker is in the credential dumpingphase of their attack. They likely performed Remote System Discovery (T1018) procedures ahead of this, such as anARP scan. They are also likely conducting some more active credential dumping probes, such as OS Credential Dumping (T1003)sub-techniques like Mimikatz or LSASS memory dumps. You may also see additional passive dumping attempts, such as Input Capture (T1056),where an attacker is monitoring the user's action, waiting for them to enter credentials through their normal activities.
