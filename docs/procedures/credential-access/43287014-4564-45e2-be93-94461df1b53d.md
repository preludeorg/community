### A hacker's perspective

Running scripts via a shell executor is usually a surefire way to get caught. Most teams have script block logging andcheck for the execution of powershell scripts or bash commands. We can circumvent this by working directly with theOperating System API to achieve our objective. On a windows system, this means making calls directly to the WindowsAPI to achieve our objectives. On *nix systems, that means making system calls directly or leveraging internal libraries.In this example, we have a *demonstration only* version of how to dump LSASS memory using the MiniDumpWriteDump functionin the Windows API.

### Expected output

A temporary file is created with a memory dump from LSASS.

### Basic variations

There is a better version of this that leverages the PPSSnapShot function to create a snapshot of LSASS then callsMiniDumpWriteDump against that snapshot. This is the method used by ProcDump when the `-r` flag is used. This solution isbetter because instead of dumping memory directly from lsass, we are using native API calls to dump memory from a snapshotof lsass. An even better variant is using a tool call Dumpert, which unhooks windows API calls and uses direct systemcalls to run an in-memory LSASS credential dump that bypasses normal AV/EDR solutions.

### How it is chained

A more advanced adversary will use a tool like WdToggle to enable WDigest credential caching on a system, then load a toolin memory (like dumpert) to dump LSASS memory. Once an adversary has dumped memory from lsass.exe, the next step will beexfiltrating the dump file and attempting to get hashes or plain-text credentials from the memory dump that can be usedfor pass the hash and other persistence (T1041|T1003.001|T1136) or lateral movement actions (T1041|T1003.001|T1550.002).
