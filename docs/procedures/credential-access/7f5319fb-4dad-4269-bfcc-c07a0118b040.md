### A hacker's perspective

---

Often times an attacker will get access to a user's credentials. The attacker will typically attempt to use the same credential against multiple services. This technique is referred to as credential stuffing or password reuse. 

### Expected output

---

```json.valid_smb: Yes```

### Basic variations

---

This technique can be used against any service that requires credentials to login.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Using different passwords for every account or enabling two-factor authentication provides sufficient protection against password reuse attacks. 

### How it is chained

---

This technique is typically executed after credentials have been acquired and is used during an attacker's lateral movement on the network.
