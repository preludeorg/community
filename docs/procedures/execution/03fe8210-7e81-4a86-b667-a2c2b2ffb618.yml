### A hacker's perspective

---

WellMess malware, used by APT 29, is a remote access tool that provides basic command execution and encrypted command and control. The sample provided in this TTP has been disarmed - the malware's main event loop exits immediately and does not run any of the malware's core logic.  Additional information on WellMess can be found on the [CISA bulletin](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-198b).


### Expected output

---

No usable shell output anticipated.

### Basic variations

---

No significant variations will exist for this.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Standard malware detection and prevention practices apply such use of AV or EDR. Additonally, CISA has published multiple YARA rules targeting WellMess.

### How it is chained

---

After gaining initial access via exploitation, WellMess is staged and used to establish an encrypted channel.  The adversary may then deploy post-exploitation scripts, use the built-in bot commands for command execution and file upload/download, or deploy Go Simple Tunnel (Gost) to establish a SOCKS5 proxy (T1572).
