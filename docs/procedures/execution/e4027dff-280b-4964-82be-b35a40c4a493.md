### A hacker's perspective

I need to know if my current security context will allow me to remotely execute commands on a target system. Onemethod for testing that is using PsExec to run a generic command. A successful test execution tells me that my currentpermissions are sufficient to spawn processes on the target system, meaning that I have the ability to executemy planned follow-on actions.

### Expected output

Copyright information and exit code 0 will be displayed in the console if the test is successful.

### Basic variations

Any other shell commands can easily be swapped in place of the `whoami` part of the command as part of this test. Forexample, I could save the contents of the current directory to a file by executing the command `PsExec64.exe \\#{ip.T1135}dir > output.txt`.

### Prevent + Detect

Beyond simple hash checking for the PsExec binary, the overall methodology PsExec uses to execute remote code throughthe service control manager API is fairly well known. PsExec will establish an SMB connection with the target systemand send a copy of PSEXECSVC.EXE to the remote ADMIN$ share, where it starts the remote service to enable named pipecommunications between the local and remote process (\\.\pipe\PSEXECSVC*). Monitor for Windows security event ID 7045with the default service name (PSEXECSVC). Additionally look for Windows security event ID 5145 with Relative TargetName matching the PSExecSvc nomenclature ([Binary Name]-[Machine Name]-[Random Digits]-[stdin|stdout|stderr]). From abehavioral standpoint, monitor for the creation of new services and prevent that if possible.

### How it is chained

After testing PsExec functionality and validating that it works, the next logical step will be leveraging serviceexecution to remotely stage tools on systems via PsExec's default SMB Admin Share (T1569.002|T1570|T1021.002)methodology. Those payloads could be my own agents for maintaining persistence, ransomware which would be used toencrypt files on the system (T1486), or several other tactics depending upon my overall objectives.
