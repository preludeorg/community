### A hacker's perspective

---

The difference between a "hacker" and an "APT" is that with an APT you might never know you got compromised. APTs spend a tremendous effort in hiding and cleaning up after themselves. They often live fully in memory and never write to disk.

### Expected output

---

Like most defense-evasion techniques, no usable console output is expected from this command. 

### Basic variations

---

This is a separate TTP that cleans up the source code insertion. Often times this might be written into the agent itself as a clean up procedure. Putting the agent in charge of cleanup often ensures that there is a backup plan if C2 access is lost.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Identify files that should not be written to and log any writes to these files. Library files should **likely** never be written to from a local user, only the package manager should be allowed to write to these files.

### How it is chained

---

This is type of TTP will occur after access was gained and will often be the last TTP in a chain.
