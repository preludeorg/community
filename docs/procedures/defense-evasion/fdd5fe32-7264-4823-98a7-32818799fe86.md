### A hacker's perspective

---

C shared libraries offer a lot of flexibility when it comes to deploying capabilities on a target system. DLLs are easily injectable using a strategy like Reflective DLL injection and allow me to bypass Application Whitelisting by side-loading (or otherwise hijacking) the normal execution flow for trusted binaries. 

### Expected output

---

A new agent will beacon in to Operator over HTTP on the Kaseya range. 

### Basic variations

---

You can update the Agent Configuration TTP to change the range, contact, address, and debug state. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

EDRs will detect DLLs that export ServiceCrtMain. Monitor executables that launch and the types of DLLs that they load. During investigations, check the version information on the executable that was used for Side-loading and make sure that your enterprise blocks old versions of those executables. 

### How it is chained

---

This TTP was seen in the Kaseya VSA attack to initiate a ransomware attack. The attackers disabled security controls, staged several payloads in C:\Windows, then launched an agent.exe payload that dropped a ransomware DLL as mpsvc.dll which is sideloaded using MsMpEng.exe (T1562.001|T1074.001|T1574.002|T1486).
