### A hacker's perspective

---

Covering my tracks comes first. Once I gain an initial foothold (i.e., compromise a computer) in a network, this is one of the first procedures I reach for. It is a two step procedure. Step #1 is to clear out the previous history, which ensures the tracks are wiped related to how I gained the foothold. Step #2 is to disable history moving forward, ensuring that my future commands on the computer are not logged. Defensive operators rely on logs to determine if a hacker has infiltrated their systems. These logs are matched up to known attack patterns and alerts can be triggered. By stopping logging altogether, an adversary can create a blindspot for the defense. 

### Expected output

---

No console output should come from running this command. 

### Basic variations

---

Agents may run their commands under different executors, such as shell executors (like Bash and PowerShell) or languages such as Python or Node. Depending on which executor is used, the way it hides its tracks will be different. Programmatic languages may be trickier to see, as they can often mask their commands within the language itself. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

Look for any statement which clears or stops logging on a computer. Secondarily, ensure you are using a centralized logging system, where all logs from a computer are sent. Ensure this system verifies that each computer is actively sending logs in (i.e., nothing turned off the logging agent). Otherwise, it should trigger an alert. 

### How it is chained

---

This is one of the first procedures an adversary is likely to trigger. It is also likely to be done in succession with other defense evasion procedures, such as Hide Artifacts (T1564) to make their agent file hidden or any number of other sub-techniques under Impair Defenses (T1562), such as Indicator Blocking or Disable or Modify (Local|Cloud) Firewall.
