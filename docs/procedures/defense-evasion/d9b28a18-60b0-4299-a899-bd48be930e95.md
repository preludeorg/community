### A hacker's perspective

---

Many defenders rely on SysMon for granular end-point telemetry because it is freely available and effective configurations exist online; a good SysMon setup can catch a large number of adversary actions. So we want to be able to neuter that capability as quickly as possible when attacking a system. Disabling SysMon will require Administrative privileges, as it requires unloading Minifilter drivers from the kernel filter manager. Instead of disabling SysMon immediately, we should first actually look for and review the SysMon configuration on the target system. In all likelihood there will be some file and folder exclusions in the configuration, and we can leverage those blindspots to operate from. 

### Expected output

---

No standard out will be produced, but the SysmonDrv Minifilter will be disabled. 

### Basic variations

---

There are a few ways to disable SysMon on a target. In this instance, the Minifilter driver is unloaded as a means to cripple SysMon, but it is also possisble to simply uninstall with `sysmon.exe -u`. Alternatively, update or delete the existing SysMon configuration to avoid detection using `sysmon.exe -c sysmonconfig-export.xml`. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

Create detections for any attempts to unload the SysmonDrv Minifilter or attempts to uninstall Sysmon in general. Monitor SysMon Event ID 23 (FileDeletion) and Event ID 11 (FileCreate) on the system's Sysmon configuration XML file in order to detect deletion or over-writing of the Sysmon configuration file. Event ID 5 (Process terminated) alerts against the Sysmon process would also indicate potential adversary behavior. If there are folder and file exclusions in the sysmon configuration, consider setting up a Canary that would aid in detecting adversaries attempting to operate in blind spots of the configuration. For example, store a password file or generic configuration file that contains passwords in one of those locations. If you get any Windows event ID 4656 and 4663 associated with the file, it is likely malicious. 

### How it is chained

---

The attacker has administrative access at this point and disabling Sysmon would enable them to operate more freely without being detected. After the adversary unloads the filter driver they might attempt to escalate privileges to system then dump credentials from lsass process memory (T1543.003|T1003.001). An attacker might also start performing more local file discovery and being staging data for eventual exfiltration (T1083|T1074.001|T1071.001).
