### Metadata

This is a man page for a TTP available in Operator. Man pages provide additional context around procedures and should be consulted if you are looking to learn about a particular chain.

- *TTP Identifier*: 8810b515-6c98-47a5-b2a2-e35597f3dcd2
- *MITRE Technique ID*: [T1027.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003/)

### A hacker's perspective

---

Endpoint detection and AV software detect payloads when directly stored on disk. On top of this, attackers will want to obtain information about the system before gaining persistence. To do both, hackers employ a technique called "staging" which involves running a program to "install" malware in stages.
Steganography is one such technique used to hide the payload in the system in order to avoid direct detection.

### Expected output

---

Usually the output will be a file. This file may be another stager or the backdoor or a configuration for the C2.

### Basic variations

---

Some variations include storing a file within a file and file format obfuscation.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Detection would involve behavioural indicators. Usually the decoding stage is ephemeral and little evidence is left. The defender should monitor for unknown executables and file writes to temporary directories within the system.

### How it is chained

---

Since steganogrpaphy generates files as its output itis often chained with execution or command and control TTPs.
