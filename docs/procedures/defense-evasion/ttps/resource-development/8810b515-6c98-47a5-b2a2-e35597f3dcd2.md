### A hacker's perspective

---

Attackers need to obtain information about a system before gaining persistence, but endpoint detection and anti-virus software can detect payloads stored on disk. Hackers may employ a technique called "staging" which involves running multiple steps (or stages) to ingress and run a payload. Steganography is a technique used to hide the payload in the system in order to avoid direct detection.

### Expected output

---

Usually the output will be a file. This file may be another stager, the backdoor, or a configuration for the C2.

### Basic variations

---

Some variations include storing a file within a file, and file format obfuscation.

### Prevent + Detect

---

Detection would involve behavioural indicators. Usually the decoding stage is ephemeral and little evidence is left. The defender should monitor for unknown executables and file writes to temporary directories within the system.

### How it is chained

---

Since steganography generates files as its output, it is often chained with execution or command and control TTPs.
