### A hacker's perspective

---

Many Anti-Virus (AV) products scan binaries when they are saved on a target system. We can get around this by avoiding saving payloads to the target and instead using in-memory loading techniques to store and execute the payload. This particular strategy where the Windows Anti-Malware Scanning Interface (AMSI) is patched for the current powershell process, then an existing Reflective PE/DLL Injection script from PowerSploit. Because AMSI is disabled, we are able to load a known malicious script an inject any properly formatted PE or DLL. 

### Expected output

---

Depending upon the payload, there will be verbose output from the Reflective Injection script followed by the output/results from the injected payload. 

### Basic variations

---

Depending upon the type of payload, this harness works for multiple different simple versions of payloads. There are several variations of in-memory payload loading that exist each depending on the objective and type of payload. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

Remote injection of a DLL/PE into a process always starts with a process attach step. A reliable detection is configuring SysMon to check for event ID 10 (ProcessAccess) which would indicate a process has tried to open and access another process. SysMon also has an event ID 25 (ProcessTampering) which is generated when process hiding techniques such as "hollow" or "herpaderp" are detected. 

### How it is chained

---

Process Injection is commonly used for defense evasion and privilege escalation techniques. By avoid touching anything except memory, an attacker can inject a payload that steals the current processes security token and possibly leverage that to escalate to higher permissions (T1055.002|T1134.001).
