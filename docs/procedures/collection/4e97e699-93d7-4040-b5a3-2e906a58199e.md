### A hacker's perspective

---

As part of many exfiltration operations, staging files is a critical task. After identifying files of interest, instead of exfiltrating them where they are, I'll usually copy the file (not move!) to a staging directory that I have either created or am using on the computer. This staging location is where I put any files I think have value and want to steal from the computer. This procedure stages a single file at a time. Note how there are two variables used in the command, one for the file itself and the other for the staging directory. These are prereqs to me being able to conduct the procedure. 

### Expected output

---

None. This command will not output any standard out. 

### Basic variations

---

Copying a file is a normally benign action. It causes no ill effects. There are several GUI and shell variations of copying the file, such as using the Copy-Item or cp utilities on Windows/Unix, or using a programmatic language (like a C-variant or Python) to copy a file on the system. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

Install and enable file-based monitoring to look for a large number of copied files in a short period of time, especially those which are initiated by a shell executor such as bash or PowerShell. 

### How it is chained

---

Expect this procedure to be preceded by the creation of a staging directory and the discovery of files. Also, expect this procedure to be run many times in a short period of time, as the adversary stages files they find of importance. This time period could be a few seconds or over the course of a day. Following this procedure, you're likey to see a procedure compressing the staged directory in a final step preceding the directory being stolen off the computer (T1074|T1005|T1560.001).
