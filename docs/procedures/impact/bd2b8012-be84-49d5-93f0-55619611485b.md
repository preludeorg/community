### A hacker's perspective

Depending on your goals, sometimes gaining access to a network and control over a system is only a means toan end, and though the system itself may not be inherently valuable to an attacker, the knowledge that itmay be incredibly valuable to it's more legitimate users, on the other hand, who likely depend on their abilityto access and work with all the files and data stored on it for their day to day lives and operation createsa vector that an attacker can then leverage by simply withholding access to those very files and data. One of theways they can do this is by encrypting important files and deleting the originals, then extorting users anddemanding a ransom if they want to gain back access to their data.

### Expected output

An encrypted copy of a users file, protected by the password "password123", and stored beside the originalwith the extension ".enc"

### Basic variations

Though this procedure depends on openssl and encrypts files using AES-256, there are many ways an attacker canencrypt files, which may or may not depend on third party dependencies. For example, the Ryuk ransomware, whichfirst emerged in mid 2018, and derives from the Hermes ransomware, is distributed as a standalone executable thatonce able to infect a system uses a set of pre-generated public-private key pairs to encrypt files withRSA-2048 and AES-256.

### Prevent + Detect

This particular script depends on access to a system level dependency that restricting access to is likely to interruptmany of the other much more legitimate operations that users are likely to want to perform, which makes preventionat that level an unlikely tradeoff an administrator is going to be willing to make. The best way to protect againstthis type of attack is to maintain well protected backups that an attacker is unlikely to be able to gain access tosuch that it's always possible to recover from this type of scenario. Furthermore, since this is a technique verytypically employed by various ransomware, ensuring that you, in turn, have good ransomware protection in placeis a good way to help prevent this type of attack from ever happening in the first place.

### How it is chained

Interal defacement will completely give away an adversary's presence on a network, so typically this action is onlytaken after all other adversary objectives are completed. That being said, using internal defacement to cover otheractions is possible; an adversary might deface desktops to drop a completely unrelated web shell persistence (T1505.003)before egressing the network.Since the point of this behaviour is typically to stage files right before an adversary deletes the originals andreaches out to make demands to the user (which therefore makes their presence known and risks cutting off access to the network),this action typically takes place at the end of a long reconnaissance and discovery (T1005) where the adversary tries tolearn what files are likely to be most valuable to the user and likely to solicit the highest ransom when those demands are made.
