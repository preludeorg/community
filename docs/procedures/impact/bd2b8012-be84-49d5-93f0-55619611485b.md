### A hacker's perspective

---

Depending on your goals, sometimes gaining access to a network and control over a system is only a means to an end, and though the system itself may not be inherently valuable to an attacker, the knowledge that it may be incredibly valuable to it's more legitimate users, on the other hand, who likely depend on their ability to access and work with all the files and data stored on it for their day to day lives and operation creates a vector that an attacker can then leverage by simply withholding access to those very files and data. One of the ways they can do this is by encrypting important files and deleting the originals, then extorting users and demanding a ransom if they want to gain back access to their data. 

### Expected output

---

An encrypted copy of a users file, protected by the password "password123", and stored beside the original with the extension ".enc" 

### Basic variations

---

Though this procedure depends on openssl and encrypts files using AES-256, there are many ways an attacker can encrypt files, which may or may not depend on third party dependencies. For example, the Ryuk ransomware, which first emerged in mid 2018, and derives from the Hermes ransomware, is distributed as a standalone executable that once able to infect a system uses a set of pre-generated public-private key pairs to encrypt files with RSA-2048 and AES-256. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

This particular script depends on access to a system level dependency that restricting access to is likely to interrupt many of the other much more legitimate operations that users are likely to want to perform, which makes prevention at that level an unlikely tradeoff an administrator is going to be willing to make. The best way to protect against this type of attack is to maintain well protected backups that an attacker is unlikely to be able to gain access to such that it's always possible to recover from this type of scenario. Furthermore, since this is a technique very typically employed by various ransomware, ensuring that you, in turn, have good ransomware protection in place is a good way to help prevent this type of attack from ever happening in the first place. 

### How it is chained

---

Interal defacement will completely give away an adversary's presence on a network, so typically this action is only taken after all other adversary objectives are completed. That being said, using internal defacement to cover other actions is possible; an adversary might deface desktops to drop a completely unrelated web shell persistence (T1505.003) before egressing the network.  Since the point of this behaviour is typically to stage files right before an adversary deletes the originals and reaches out to make demands to the user (which therefore makes their presence known and risks cutting off access to the network), this action typically takes place at the end of a long reconnaissance and discovery (T1005) where the adversary tries to learn what files are likely to be most valuable to the user and likely to solicit the highest ransom when those demands are made.
