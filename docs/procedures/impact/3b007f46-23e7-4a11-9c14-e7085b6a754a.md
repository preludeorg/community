### A hacker's perspective

---

Impact procedures are usually a last-resort, ditch effort when I want to exit an environment without caring if I'm seen or not. This procedure is no different: I am force closing an installed application. I would typically complete a command like this because either I need the app to restart to take advantage of a configuration change I made or this is a link in a chain of destructive procedures I'm running simultaneously. In the latter case, I could be force closing various applications and destroying the database(s) fueling them. Or I may be breaking the applications to put them into an endless loop when they restart. Or I may be injecting my agent into the application, which will take effect on the next reboot of the app. In any case, this is a delicate procedure to execute, as it will be noticed. Hopefully, most people will disregard the closure as a "bug" and just attempt to restart it. But it is something to be mindful of before executng this (or really any) impact procedure. 

### Expected output

---

None. This command will not output any standard out. 

### Basic variations

---

For variations, there are two types: program quit and technical way we did the quitting. For the first case, in this procedure we use the variable app.T1518 as the app we want to quit. This will get replaced in real-time with an application name, as collected by any previously run T1082 procedure. This could reasonably be any valid application name. In the second case, there are a few ways to force-kill an app. On Windows and MacOS, you can easily open a "CMD+ALT+DELETE" window and see/kill any running application. Programmatically, you can leverage any shell executor to complete the action as well. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

A single force-kill is not a big deal. These occur all the time. You should look for several kills in a row as a sign of malicious activity. 

### How it is chained

---

Impact procedures tend to be bunched together in quick succession, so look for this in an almost parallel chain. Also look for a chain which includes some Software Discovery (T1518) before this procedure is executed. This may help identify the malicious attack earlier, so you don't need to wait for several impact effects.
