### A hacker's perspective

---

Stopping processes and services is useful in many situations. I can disable defensive tools by stopping the processes that are either collecting or sending data to a SIEM. Or, I can stop critical services like exchange, DNS, and so on to create a denial of service in the target network. This kind of attack is particularly dangerous in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems; I could potentially disable security mechanisms and cause actual damage to a hardware system depending on the attack. This has serious implications when, for example, those hardware systems are power distribution centers for entire regions or medical devices keeping patients alive. 

### Expected output

---

Standard out will return a table that shows the processes that were stopped. 

### Basic variations

---

A very simple variation of this is using the DOS command version `taskkill /IM "#{process.T1057}" /F` to kill a process by name. It is also possible to stop a process by PID using `taskkill /F /PID #{process.ID}`. 

### Prevent + Detect

---

Command line telemetry will help detect usage of the Get-Process command, but that will have many false positives to sift through. Monitoring calls to Stop-Process might be a good alternative, but that would be after the process is already stopped. In general, you want to catch the adversary prior to their impact stage. 

### How it is chained

---

Adveraries will stop critical processes prior to attacking underlying data stores for those processes (T1489|T1485). An adversary might also attempt to stop processes for security tools prior to more "noisy" actions like data exfiltration or credential dumping techniques (T1489|T1567.002) (T1489|T1003).
