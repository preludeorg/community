# Professional license

#### Designed for those who want continuous cutting-edge TTPs

---

The Operator Professional license is designed for red, blue or purple team members,
penetration testers, security engineers or others who are looking to perform offensive security 
in a professional setting. 

### TTP Tuesday subscription

---

Every Tuesday, the Prelude security team releases a new [attack chain](https://chains.prelude.org) containing a handful of TTPs.
Each chain is loaded into Operator automatically and can be executed against your connected agents. Chains are designed 
using open-source intelligence (OSINT) and often model either real world threat groups or common attack patterns seen in the wild.
The idea is simple: by getting a continuous stream of high quality ready to run attacks, you can perform security testing more frequently.

### Managing tokens

---

Operator also supports the use of personal tokens that can be created and linked to your account. This pairing allows you to authenticate your log in headlessly, thereby removing the need to authenticate your account upon every log in attempt.

#### Create your token and secret key

To create your keys, log into your [Headquarters](https://login.prelude.org/#/) and navigate to your user Settings. Once there you will find the 'Manage Tokens' option at the bottom of the page. Here you can create and manage your tokens which can be used to authenticate your headless login:

```bash
./headless-linux --accountEmail=email@host.org --accountToken=95cdbb5d-adcd-430f-ad00-b88562f25aa5 --accountSecret=3dd6e2cf-dec9-446a-9c4a-8e31ee5414af
```

### Private support

---

Professional license holders gain access to a private Discord channel where they can get 1-on-1 support from the Prelude team. 
Additionally, those in the channel are invited to our cohort
meeting - every 6 weeks - where the Prelude team demos upcoming features and talks about the roadmap.
