# Professional license

#### Designed for those who want continuous cutting-edge TTPs

---

The Operator Professional license is designed for red, blue or purple team members,
penetration testers, security engineers, consultants or others who are looking to perform offensive security 
in a professional setting. 

### TTP Tuesday subscription

---

Every Tuesday, the Prelude security team releases a new [attack chain](https://chains.prelude.org) containing a handful of TTPs.
Each chain is loaded into Operator automatically and can be executed against your connected agents. Chains are designed 
using open-source intelligence (OSINT) and often model either real world threat groups or common attack patterns seen in the wild.
The idea is simple: by getting a continuous stream of high quality, ready-to-execute attacks, you can perform security testing continuously.

### Private support

---

Professional license holders gain access to a private Discord channel where they can get 1-on-1 support from the Prelude team. 
Additionally, those in the channel are invited to our cohort
meeting - every 6 weeks - where the Prelude team demos upcoming features and talks about the roadmap.
