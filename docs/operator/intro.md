# Meet the Prelude Operator

#### Unlock continuous security and execute like a pro

---

Prelude Operator is an automated red teaming platform, packed into a desktop application. Operator is
free to use and has open-sourced the components you should expect out of a security tool: the attacks
you run (TTPs) and the things that run the attacks (agents). This is an actively supported project
with the technical team available on the Discord server.

### Post-compromise

---

While it can be used to conduct initial access, Operator focuses mainly on post-compromise. In other words,
it assumes that a bad actor has found their way into your network (i.e., you deploy an agent on a chosen
"compromised" computer) and it tests your defenses from that moment forward.

### How do I use my Operator?

---

Start by reading these docs, to get familiar with the tool and terminology. Then head to the Train section and
take the Introduction program which brings the documentation to life. The program walks you through all major components
of the system and has you deploying agents, building adversaries and executing operations. Once complete, you should
be ready to start running your own security assessments through Operator. 

Operator includes an optional light mode. Open your dev console and enter the script below to use it.


#### Enable light mode

```javascript
$("body").addClass("inverted");
```

### Community license

---

Each time Operator boots, it loads the resources from our [Community](https://github.com/preludeorg/community) repository.
This repo contains all open-source TTPs, adversaries, plugins and training modules. Please contribute, as 
anything here is picked up automatically for all Operator members! Community members gain access to more than 100
TTPs, free and open-source agents, training programs and a set of plugins which integrate with other technology 
and security tools. What's unique about Operator is that there's no "full" version of the platform: what you see is what you get. Read the doc pages for Professional and Enterprise licenses for details on upgrading.
