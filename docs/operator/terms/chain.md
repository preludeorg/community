# What is a chain

#### Executing an organized attack

---

A chain is an unordered collection of procedures files. Think of a chain in video game terms; it is
an empty profile or shell, and it gets more powerful as you add specific abilities to it.

### Scheduling

---

You can schedule a chain to run on a specific day of the week at a specific time and against a specific range.
Scheduling can only occur from the API.

### Build your own chain

---

You can construct your own chains through the Editor plugin. You can
build your chain based on a real-world threat actor (APT group) or based on custom
attack patterns you want to test. Construct your chain using tags, which organize procedures by categories.
Note that the TTPs you add are unordered. It is the role of the planner to determine which order they are executed, if at all.
Each week, we release a new chain on our [chains website](https://chains.prelude.org), for Professional license holders.
