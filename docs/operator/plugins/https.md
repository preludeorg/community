# HTTPS plugin

### What is HTTPS?

---

HTTPS is a plugin that supplies Operator with an additional agent listening post, for https, at port 8443. By default,
Operator supports HTTP, TCP and UDP protocols.

Once installed, you can point agents at https/8443. Expect this endpoint to behave like a typical API backed by 
a self-signed certificate.
