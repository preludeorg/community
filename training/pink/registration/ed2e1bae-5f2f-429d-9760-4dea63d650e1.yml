  What will this program teach me?: |
    By taking the Pink Badge training program, you will learn the basic components that make up cybersecurity. You will
    learn the tools and processes that are commonly used to secure today's workplace and you will dive deeper into the
    mysterious world of red teaming - or computer hacking for good. This multi-week, self-paced program will walk you
    through deploying agents on target computers, crafting attacks, building adversary profiles and the process of converting the
    results of a red team exercise into action. The program is geared toward existing IT or InfoSec professionals, who are
    charged with securing organizations but may not have access or education in the cutting-edge tools and processes used
    by larger enterprises or governments. Our goal is that you can use your new skills to secure your organization.
  What should I expect?: |
    Each week, you will face multiple challenges in a capture-the-flag style. You will need to prove your knowledge by
    "capturing" each flag. Some will be easy, and test your reading comprehension, others will be difficult and will
    validate your capability behind the keyboard. Each week should take 1-2 hours to complete, with the exception of
    week 2 which is more robust and can take 5-10 hours. Many flags will include recordings with first-hand
    accounts of red team work in the field by experienced professionals.
