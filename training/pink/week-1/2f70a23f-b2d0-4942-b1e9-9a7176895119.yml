name: Red, blue and purple
challenge: |
  Fill in the blank: a red team submits an __ report with security recommendations.
context: |
  When all other security measures are in place - asset inventory, antivirus or EDR, vulnerability scanning - a mature
  organization will start incorporating red teaming. A red team plays the role of an adversary and
  practices hacking into an organization in order to identify the various ways an attacker could wreak havoc. The blue team,
  or those in charge of defense, will monitor the red team's process and incorporate the recommendations they supply.
  A purple team is the mixture of both red and blue and has members who are comfortable working on both offense and defense.
  The goal of red teaming is to test the existing defenses, whether tools, people or processes, in order to be ready
  if and when an adversary strikes.

blocks: 
  Red team:  |
    Red teams use TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to emulate the behavior of likely attackers in the most realistic way 
    possible. It is similar to, but not the same as, penetration testing. Red teaming is very objective focused - and is usually
    executed as a campaign. 
  Blue team:  |
    Blue teams defend the organization against real and emulated attacks. They utilize tools like EDRs, SIEMs and other detection/response
    software to continuously improve against attacks. 
  Purple team:  |
    Purple teams utilize a philosophy to bring together both offensive and defensive mentalities to improve overall security. Purple teams
    generally use emulations to quickly test various attacks and defensive responses.
