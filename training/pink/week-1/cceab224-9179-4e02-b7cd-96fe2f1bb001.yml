name: Scanning for vulnerabilities
challenge: |
  What is the acronym used to catalog known vulnerabilities?
context: |
  Vulnerability scanning is the process of locating known security vulnerabilities in applications. When security
  researchers find a security issue in an application, they will work with the author of the app to resolve it, in a
  process known as responsible disclosure. Once the author patches the vulnerability, they will release a patch to all
  users and credit the researcher with finding the bug. Often the researcher will be paid through a "bug bounty" program.

  Authenticated scan:  |
    These scans occur when permission is given to directly access network based assets using remote admin protocols (like SSH).
    This allows the scanner to access lower-level data, such as configuration details. The accuracy of these scans tend to be high
    because the low-level access provides fidelity into configuration issues and missing software patches. 
  Unauthenticated scan:  |
    These scans occur without permission to directly access network assets. Threat actors or security analysts will typically 
    perform unauthenticated scans to determine the security posture of externally accessible assets.
