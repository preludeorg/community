name: The role of antivirus
challenge: |
  What is the name of the popular service used to check if a file is malware?
context: |
  Malware, or malicious software, can be a file or a process on a computer (or any device, really) that is meant to do harm.
  Malware can cause destruction - like ransomware, spyware, like recording your webcam, or can just be a mechanism for an
  adversary to control your computer any way they please. Antivirus is software that is designed to locate and remediate malware.
  It does this by cataloging all known "malware samples" - or variations of malicious software - and calculating a file hash for them.
  It then scans your computer frequently, looking for matches against the bad samples. When a match is found, an antivirus program
  will typically quarantine it by putting it in a sandbox on the computer for the user to review and either delete completely or
  "white card" it and mark it as a false positive.
