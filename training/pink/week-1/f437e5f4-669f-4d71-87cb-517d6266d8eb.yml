name: Endpoint Detection & Response
challenge: |
  Fill in the blank: there are two types of EDR available, agent and __
context: |
  Modern defensive products have sprung up to catch adversaries who use tactics and techniques that evade antivirus. These
  products are known as EDR and are designed to look for adversarial behavior on a computer, not file signatures like AV.
  EDR programs run constantly in the background of a computer and send results back to a centralized logging server,
  where the results are analyzed and generate alerts if bad behavior is seen. EDR tools are also programmed to respond in
  real-time, to shut down known bad behavior when it is seen. This is the "response" part of EDR and similar to an antivirus,
  malicious activities are often put in a sandbox for an administrator to look at and either confirm or mark as a false positive.
  Most of the time, you should not use both antivirus and EDR on a workstation (laptop or computer) because they perform overlapping
  duties and can slow down a computer (or worse, they'll each think the other is malicious!).

  Endpoints:  |
    An endpoint is any device that is physically an 'end' point on a network. Examples include laptops, desktops, mobile phones,
    servers and virtual environments. 
  Detection & Response: |
    D&R refers to the part of cybersecurity that enables organizations to monitor network traffic for malicious actors and 
    suspicious behavior. EDR tools allows organizations to detect malicious traffic and perform automated or manual responses to 
    the unique threat.
