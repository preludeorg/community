name: Importance of asset inventory
challenge: |
  Fill in the blank: the NIST 800-__ describes a list of procedures to follow in order to secure your organization.
context: |
  The very first step in securing an organization is conducting asset inventory: what computers do you have, what
  are they connected to, who has possession of them, and how do you ensure they are patched? If you cannot answer these
  questions today, don't introduce additional security measures until you can. The National Institute of Standards
  and Technology (NIST) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. It maintains a set of standards which
  outlines how to best practice cybersecurity. Inventory audit is one of those standards and it serves as the foundation
  of good cyber hygiene. Keeping tabs on the suggestions within NIST is a great place to start your journey to a more
  secure organization. Once you have a process for tracking the computers, phones and devices your company connects to
  its network, make sure you have a process for ensuring they are updated when updates are available.
