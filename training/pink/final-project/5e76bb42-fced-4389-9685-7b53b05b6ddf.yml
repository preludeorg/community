name: Your final project
challenge: |
  Install the Protect application and pass the first flag
context: |
  Protect is a lightweight endpoint product that continously tests your cyber hygiene. It does this by running safe
  adversary attacks, monitoring how you react, and supplying you with quick training modules when you make a mistake.
  The goal of Protect is to improve your security through better education. It will do things such
  as look for plain-text passwords, try to trick you into giving it permissions, see if you notice it turning on your
  microphone and more. Where Operator is intended for security pros, Protect is intended to help strengthen the security
  of everyone inside an organization, technical or not.
  To complete your final project, install Protect, log in, then leave your computer on for at least 4 hours
  (you can do other things). Then click the Prelude icon in your system tray to view the available training module.
  Pass this flag, then refresh Operator and verify you have completed Pink Badge.
