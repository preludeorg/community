challenge: |
  Fill in the blank: improving the cyber __ of your employees is the most important security measure you can take.
context: |
  People are the biggest vulnerability - by far - at your organization. Left alone, the laptops and devices in your organization
  could be quite secure. Its only when people start using them that security really starts dissipating. Because of this, your
  security testing should focus on improving the behavior of your employees while on their devices. Phishing gets the most
  attention when it comes to testing an employee's behavior. However, this only tests the initial access stage of a cyber
  attack. You should focus most of your behavior testing toward the post-compromise state of an attack. This includes
  testing if employees: report a ransomware attack, click on randomly added files on their computer, click 'yes' when
  asked to give permission to an unknown process, allow drive-by downloads and more. Continuous behavior-driven testing
  of your people, coupled with easy-to-follow training, will yield the most results in your quest for a more secure
  organization.

  Initial Access:  |
    Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. 
    Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. 
    Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, 
    or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.
  Post-compromise:  |
    A focus on adversary behavior after they have gained access to a system within a network. A 'post-compromise mindset' helps develop 
    a defensive posture centered around the assumption that an adversary will succeed in their initial access attempt.
