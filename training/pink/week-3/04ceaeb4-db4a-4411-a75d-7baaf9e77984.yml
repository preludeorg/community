name: Becoming more secure
challenge: Click to start this week
context: |
  In this third week you will learn how to take the results from security testing and create a more secure environment
  within your organization. There are two types of improvements you'll learn to make: technology and people. Many organizations
  that do security testing don't do a good job at converting the results into action, so understanding the content this
  week is critical. A red team exercise is of no value if it doesn't result in improving security.
