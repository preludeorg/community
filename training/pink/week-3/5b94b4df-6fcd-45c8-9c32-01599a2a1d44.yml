challenge: |
  Which solution should catch an adversary locating and exfiltrating sensitive files from an employee workstation?
context: |
  When you perform a security test (red team), you are really testing the defenses in place. This could be the people,
  process or technology responsible for securing your organization. Let's say you build an adversary profile that
  locates sensitive files, stages them into a new directory, compresses the new directory and exfiltrates the final ZIP
  out of the company network. This common attack chain is hard for a defensive solution to detect because it's comprised
  of benign actions commonplace on a regular computer: finding and copying files and zipping up directories. This attack
  could work against even the most security-focused person in your organization - and it should be resolved with a technical
  security recommendation. Technology improvements should be a common result of performing a test and could be things like
  re-configuring detection tools, installing a new solution, patching an unpatched computer, changing a default password
  on an application, or setting up a zero-trust architecture to lessen your surface area in case of a breach.

blocks: 
  Exfiltration:  |
    Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once theyâ€™ve collected data, 
    adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques 
    for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate 
    channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.
  Reconnaissance:  |
    Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to 
    support targeting. Such information may include details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. 
    This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered 
    information to plan and execute Initial Access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further 
    Reconnaissance efforts.
