name: After-action report
challenge: |
  How many sections does the audio recording suggest should be in your report?
context: |
  Reporting is the natural output of a red team exercise. You first evaluate your security, identifying technical and
    people (i.e., training) issues, then you make a plan to improve it. This after-action report should be brief and
    to the point. It should clearly articulate the problems you found and your recommendations. For the latter, the report
    should focus on short-and-long term security recommendations which have a finite "definition of done." So, instead
    of having a recommendation of "train our employees to be smarter about security" you should identify a focus area such as
    "train our employees at being able to identify suspicious files." A report should be written with management in mind, as
    both a summary of your security posture and an action-item list of things to make it better.

  Compiling data:  |
    A traditional red team report is a written document that outlines the found issues and recommended improvements.
    However, a modern report can come in many formats and displayed in many ways, such as websites. Operator has two
    ways of creating dynamic reports. The first is inside the app itself. As you launch chains, the results stream 
    into each agent dashboard in real-time so you can see what worked - and what didn't. The process of compiling this
    data into an aggregate is manual however and requires more in-depth knowledge of understanding the impact of 
    various procedures and the context of the result data. The second way to create reports is automatic: publishers.
    Enterprise accounts can attach the SIEM or EDR of their choice to Operator and all results will be published 
    to the corresponding dashboard. This allows you to house all your result data next to your already-collected log
    data, so you can see what you detected and what you did not.
