name: After-action report
challenge: |
  How many sections does the audio recording suggest should be in your report?
context: |
  Reporting is the natural output of a red team exercise. You first evaluate your security, identifying technical and
    people (i.e., training) issues, then you make a plan to improve it. This after-action report should be brief and
    to the point. It should clearly articulate the problems you found and your recommendations. For the latter, the report
    should focus on short-and-long term security recommendations which have a finite "definition of done." So, instead
    of having a recommendation of "train our employees to be smarter about security" you should identify a focus area such as
    "train our employees at being able to identify suspicious files." A report should be written with management in mind, as
    both a summary of your security posture and an action-item list of things to make it better.

  Compiling data:  |
    A traditional red team report is a written document that outlines the found issues and recommended improvements.
    However, a modern report can come in many formats and displayed in many ways, such as websites. Operator has two
    ways of creating dynamic reports for you, including recommendations. The first is through a Reports plugin (available
    to Professional license holders) which compiles red team reports for you inside Operator itself. The second is through
    a web portal at <a href="https://login.prelude.org">login.prelude.org</a> (available to Enterprise license holders)
    which displays a high-level view of all the Operator instances in your organization.
