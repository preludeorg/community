  Protect recently tried to trick you into giving up your password. What is the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic for Input Capture?
context: |
  When you do something on your computer that requires extra permisison, an input box "pops" on your screen and asks you
  to enter your password to prove you are, in fact, you. Recently, an adversary on your computer popped a similar input
  box - but this time unprompted. They were trying to trick you into giving up your password to a fake credential input
  box! This is a common technique an adversary will do in order to capture your password in a way they hope you don't notice.
  Many people just enter their password when prompted, not thinking whether they initiated the prompt or not. Before you
  enter your credentials - even on your own computer - think to yourself, did I do anything to prompt this?

    TrendMicro followed a phishing campaign targeting high-ranking executives during May 2020. The attackers would leverage
    compromised infrastructure to host fake Office 365 login pages in order to steal credentials from unsuspecting users.
    The attackers were sending emails with fake Office 365 password expiration reports as lures, prompting targets to click
    the embedded link in the email if they want to continue using the same password; choosing the “Keep Password” option
    leads the user to the phishing page (Source: TrendMicro, see attached link).
