name: Desktop screenshots captured!
challenge: |
  Can you figure out how many screenshots were taken of your system during the attack?
context: |
  Someone took several screenshots of your desktop! The attacker is hoping to find sensitive data (like passwords) in plain text
  on your desktop, but the attacker still needs a way to view the screenshots. All of the screenshots were staged in a
  folder, then the folder was archived somewhere where it would be easily accessible to the attacker. Can you find the archived
  folder and determine how many screenshots the attacker managed to take?
