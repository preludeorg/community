name: An infinite loop!
challenge: |
  The attacker used a script to create an infinite loop! Can you find the MITRE ATT&CK Tactic associated with the technique
  the attacker used: Command and Scripting Interpreter?
context: |
  Sometimes an attacker will force you into clicking a specific button or entering proper credentials by continuously prompting
  you to perform an action and never canceling out. In this case, the attacker wants you to click on the "Report..." button
  because that's going to execute another part of the script to download a malicious file. Can you go to the MITRE ATT&CK
  website an learn more about Command Scripting Interpreter attacks? What tactic is the attacker using?

hints:
  - A technique (Command and Scripting Interpreter) is one of many ways that an attacker performs a tactic
  - The attacker used the script interpreter to "execute" a task

  In the news: |
    Many attackers use Command and Scripting Interpreters to achieve their objectives. In fact, many Advanced Persistent
    Threats (APTs) are known to use them due to the simplicity, power, and realatively ubiquitious use for legitimate reasons.
    The ransomware used in the May 2021 Colonial Pipeline attack was actually launched using this approach. They used a script
    to disable the security tools, decode the ransomware file, and launch it on all of the systems under their control.
  Your take away: |
    Sometimes attackers will perform actions that are not so easily stopped or avoided. In these instances, it's important
    to contact your IT support member and explain what is going on. In some cases, the prompt might be legitimate. Your IT
    team (or security team if you company is large enough) can help you assess this.

      <li>Keep an eye out for unfamiliar pop-ups and report them to your IT staff immediately.</li>
      <li>If you encounter a pop-up that won't go away, it's worth mentioning that to someone with more knowledge of IT systems.</li>
