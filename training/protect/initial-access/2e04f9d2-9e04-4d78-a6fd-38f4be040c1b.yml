name: Someone staged a phishing email
challenge: |
  Can you find the malicious email in your Downloads folder and find the embedded link URL?
context: |
  Phishing emails are designed to trick you into clicking on a link or downloading a file. The attacker is hoping that you
  will click on the link, download the file, then run the file on your system. This attack pattern is extremely common and
  a large number of attacks begin this way. Can you find the malicious link that the attacker wants you to click on? Submit
  just the URL to that malicious file.

  In the news: |
    Phising campaigns are extremely wide spread and happening far more often in 2021. A poll of 1000 IT professionals revealed
    74% of their organizations had fallen victim to phishing attacks within the last year. Phishing attacks
    are expanding in terms of the types of devices they target now too; mobile devices are now ubiquitous targets for SMS
    and emails based phishing attacks.
  Your take away: |
    Do not click on links in emails, particularly emails that look suspicious. Instead of clicking the link, copy the URL
    to a text editor and manually inspect the link. If it looks legimate (meaning it matches what you would expect to see
    in your organization), then carefully consider whether you truly need to click on the link.

      <li>Do not click links in emails unless you recognize the link</li>
      <li>When in doubt, DO NOT CLICK.</li>
      <li>Attackers can make malicious files look like your real files, but there will be signs of manipulation, like the icon not matching other files of that type.</li>
