name: Ransom note!
challenge: |
  A hacker dropped a ransom note on your computer. What's the name of the file?
context: |
  You should always be on the look out for unfamiliar files on your computer. If you notice a new
  file in one of your common directories, such as Downloads or Documents, you should be cautious.
  When an attacker executes a ransomware attack, they will encrypt all of your files and
  leave a message behind with directions on how to pay in order to decrypt them. We simulated this behavior by leaving a ransom
  note on your computer. Can you locate it and enter the name of the note?

    In May 2021, Colonial Pipeline - who is in charge of half of the U.S. fuel supply on the East Coast - fell victim to a
    ransomware attack. The hackers stole and then held a reported 100GB of data ransom, leaving a ransom note behind on
    a computer an employee discovered shortly after the attack. Colonial Pipeline ended up paying the ransom, an estimated
    $4.4 million, in order to unlock their files and restore order to the fuel supply.
