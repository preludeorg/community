name: Malicious file dropped!
challenge: |
  When the malicious file was dropped, an automatic back-up of the file was made. What is the file extension of the back-up
  file (or full filename)?
context: |
  Many attackers gain initial access (or escalate privileges) by tricking you into clicking on files that they have specially
  built. Sometimes the attacker will attack the file to an email and hope you click on it, other times they will replace
  an existing file with their malicious version. We have simulated the later by replacing your most recently used file in
  your home directory with malicious version. Before we did that, we created a back-up to preserve the original file. Can
  you find the malicious file and the back-up file?

    Elara Claring, a large US healthcare provider, was breached in December 2020 and it was determined that the initial
    access vector was phishing. The employees did not pay attention to the file that they downloaded and clicked on it
    regardless. This directly led to over 100,000 individuals potentially having their data compromised.
