name: Create a new payload
challenge: |
  Update your ‘Hello World’ TTP to use a payload. Create a payload named "hello.txt" whose contents are 'echo "world"'.
  Rename your TTP to "Hello World with Payload" and attach your payload to it. Finally, ensure your command uses the
  payload, and then run it!
context: |
  Payloads are an essential part of a red team operation. They are separate binaries, often containing extensive logic, 
  and can be thought of as malware. A payload can be written in any computer language and is commonly compiled into a 
  single executable file or designed to be loaded into memory (to avoid detection). By default, Operator provides a variety
  of payloads - some of which include: translators, agents, and more.
  
  Instead of writing TTPs which contain numerous lines of code, consider attaching a payload that contains the bulk of
  instructions and ordering your TTP to execute the payload file.
template:
  name: submit
  data: []
resources:
  links: {}
hints:
  - When looking at your TTP, note the upload icon at the top right. Use this to attach your payload.
  - When attaching a payload it will be added to the metadata, which shows which payloads are available to the TTP.
  - Look around for other TTPs with payloads to see how they use/refer to them.

  How payloads work: |
    When you deploy TTPs containing payloads, Operator first downloads them to your Prelude workspace, specifically into 
    your payloads directory. Then Operator ships the TTP to the receiving agent, along with the URL of where to find the 
    payload. The agent makes an HTTP request back to Operator to download the payload before executing the TTP itself.
answer:
  script: |
    let payload = Object.values(Attack.a).filter(function (a) {return a.name.toLowerCase() === 'hello world'});
    Number(payload[0].metadata.payloads["hello.txt"].length > 0)
  value: 1
