challenge: |
  Locate the TTP named 'Find recent files' and write a variant for your platform that searches your /tmp (or TEMP)
  directory for recently modified files. Then deploy the TTP against your ThirdEye agent. Enter the full variant ID of
  the TTP after the operation has completed.
context: |
  Just as there are numerable procedures for any given ATT&CK technique, each procedure may have variations itself.
  In Operator, instead of creating a new TTP for each of these variations you can outline each variant in a single TTP
  file. To start, find and fork the existing 'Find recent files' TTP which will create a modified version of said TTP.
  Next follow the syntaxing for variants which can be found in the example TTP:  'Update agent beacon protocol'. 
  Once you have created and appended your variations to the new TTP, run your variant. To do this, you need to 'split'
  the TTP, which will explicitly display each variant. Remove the variants you don't want to run from your chain and 
  hit 'Deploy'. Finally, verify your work by entering the full variant ID (from the 'split' step) of the TTP.

hints:
  - The variant ID should look something like `00010203-0405-0607-0809-0a0b0c0d0e0f:global:ls:0`
  - You may want to search other TTPs to find examples of variants so you can copy the syntax.
  - Use the search feature in Launch Chain to locate the TTP.

    Learning how to identify, write and modify procedures is a valuable skill to have. For example, a procedure that
    does a port scan may look like this: `nmap -Pn example.com`. This will scan example.com for open ports but avoid
    pinging the host. You may want to include software versions in your port scan, so a variation of this command may
    be: `nmap -Pn -sV example.com`. There are likely thousands of procedure variations for each technique, as hackers
    will often modify and craft variations of commands to avoid detection.
  The /tmp directory: |
    The /tmp (or TEMP) directory on a computer stores temporary files that will be removed automatically by your operating
    system over time or after a reboot. Adversaries will often store malicious code here or use it as a home base of 
    sorts because it's an often overlooked directory.
