name: Understanding chains
challenge: We have written a couple of chains to emulate N-day attacks. Enter the name of one.
context: |
  The term chain was originally used in the CALDERA framework to describe a subset of an attacker's overall operation. 
  A chain includes n-number of individual TTPs, which work together to achieve some type of output. At Prelude, 
  oftentimes we'll build chains around a theme, like a particular exploit or hack. We explicitly tag our chains
  to make it easy for users to find those that emulate a particular type of attack or adversarial group. In the 
  real-world, adversaries may know how to execute dozens of chained attacks. We emulate this by allowing you to pick a
  prebuilt chain and then append more TTPs to it.

  Script kiddie: |
    In programming and hacking cultures, a script kiddie, skiddie or skid, is an unskilled individual who uses scripts
    or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites.
    It is generally assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs
    or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in
    computer-enthusiast communities. However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant.
  Nation state actor: |
    The Nation State Actor is one possible adversary that has a 'License to Hack'. They work for a government to disrupt
    or compromise target governments, organizations or individuals to gain access to valuable data or intelligence, and 
    can create incidents that have international significance.
  CALDERA: |
    The CALDERA framework is an open-source C2 framework, supported by The MITRE Corporation, to conduct research in 
    autonomous, adversarial decision-making. Fun fact: the core developers of CALDERA version 2+ also built the Operator
    platform.
  An example chain: |
    We often highlight the 'File Hunter' chain in Operator demonstrations because it's a cross-platform chain that
    highlights the concept well. In this chain, the included TTPs will locate recently-modified files, create a staging 
    directory, copy the found files into the directory, compress the directory, and finally exfiltrate the compressed
    file back to Operator.
  TTP Tuesday: |
    Every week, the Prelude security team publishes a new chain. The chain will have a handful of TTPs and will
    automatically load into Operator, available to Professional license holders. You can read about each chain on our
    site: https://chains.prelude.org.

    Number(Object.values(Chain.c)
      .filter((c) => c.metadata.theme === 'n-day')
      .map((c) => c.id.toLowerCase()).includes($('#answer').val().toLowerCase()))
