name: Facts
challenge: |
  Find the procedure named 'File.io exfil'. Notice how the command has a variable inside, denoted by the '#{variable}'
  syntax. What is a procedure name which could fill in this variable with a fact?
context: |
  A chain in Operator is composed of links, which are the individual TTPs used in the attack. While the chain is
  executing, Operator continuously attempts to learn about the endpoints it is attacking and parses out information from
  every executed command. These parsed results are called facts. Each fact could potentially unlock another procedure
  in the chain by matching the fact key to any variables in the command field. This means the output of a procedure can
  be fed as input to other procedures, therefore creating a dynamic operation.

hints:
  - Search for technique T1560.001. These procedures can fill in the variable.
  - Use the Launch Chain search bar to find the TTP named 'File.io exfil'. Locate the variable and note the technique ID required to fill it in.
blocks:
  Links: |
    Prelude considers each attack a chain, which is composed of 1-or-many links. Each link is a TTP which was used
    within the attack. Each link is given a unique ID, which allows Prelude to track it through the platform and 
    determine what happened and how useful it was. As you construct adversary profiles, keep an eye on the variables
    inside the commands. By leveraging how these can connect, you can build chained adversaries that use learned
    information to execute.
  Autonomous hacking: |
    When an adversary launches an attack with intelligence bundled in, this is known as autonomous hacking. Intelligence
    allows the hacker to leverage automated decision-making to offload the normally manual process. This could be for
    efficiency or speed.
  Automated planning: |
    Automated planning and scheduling, sometimes denoted as AI planning, is a branch of artificial intelligence
    that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents,
    autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles.
answer:
  script: |
    Object.values(Attack.a).filter(atk => atk.technique.id === 'T1560.001' && atk.name.toLowerCase() === $('#answer').val().toLowerCase()).length
  value: 1
