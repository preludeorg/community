name: Create a new procedure
challenge: |
  Can you create a new TTP? It should have a name of 'fall asleep' and be
  classified as an Execution tactic with a technique of 'Command and Scripting Interpreter'.
context: |
  One of the unique aspects of Operator is the ability to quickly create your own TTPs and load them in the system.
  By simply creating a new YML file and ensuring the format matches that of other files in the Community repository, you
  are able to import them either manually or through Operator itself (can you find the import button?). TTPs
  are written in a format which allows for you to describe 1+ platforms and 1+ executors per platform. Read
  about the TTP files in the documentation for a full tutorial. The point of this flag is to teach you how to create a TTP
  within Operator - not train you on writing custom attacks. In your new TTP, see if you can figure out the syntax to
  make the agent executing it pause for 5 seconds.

hints:
  - Look for the + button inside the Editor section
  - Did you save the TTP after creating it?

  Choosing a platform & executor: |
    Each TTP requires a platform (operating system) and executor (program the agent uses to run the TTP). There are 3 supported
    platforms in Operator today: windows, linux and darwin (another word for MacOS). By default, each platform can use
    a specific set of executors. Check the documentation around TTPs for a list of options.
  T1059: |
    Adversaries may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution. Python is a very popular scripting/programming
    language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line
    (via the python.exe interpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems.
    Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.Python comes with many built-in packages to interact with
    the underlying system, such as file operations and device I/O. Adversaries can use these libraries to download
    and execute commands or other scripts as well as perform various malicious behaviors.
  The sleep command: |
    sleep is a command-line utility that allows you to suspend the calling process for a specified time. In other words,
    the sleep command pauses the execution of the next command for a given number of seconds.
  ART plugin: |
    Operator includes a plugin called ART, which allows you to import the hundreds of TTPs available in the open-source
    Atomic Red Team project. Use this to bolster the number of attacks in your Operator instance.
answer:
  script: Number(Object.values(Attack.attack).filter(atk => atk.name.toLowerCase() === 'fall asleep').length)
  value: 1
