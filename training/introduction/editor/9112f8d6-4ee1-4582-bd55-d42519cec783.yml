name: Create a new payload
challenge: |
  Can you create a new payload? It should be named "hello.txt" and its contents should be "world". You can attach it
  to any TTP you like.
context: |
  Payloads are an essential part of a red team operation. They are separate binaries, often containing extensive logic, 
  and can be thought of as malware. A payload can be written in any computer language and is commonly compiled into a 
  single executable file or designed to be loaded into memory (to avoid detection). By default, Operator provides a variety
  of payloads within the Editor's 'manage payloads' window, some of which include: translators, agents, and more.
  Instead of writing TTPs which contain numerous lines of code, consider attaching a payload that contains the bulk of
  instructions and ordering your TTP to execute the payload file.

  How payloads work in operations: |
    When you deploy TTPs containing payloads, Operator first downloads them to your Prelude workspace, specifically into 
    your payloads directory (referenced through the automatic fact of #{operator.payloads}). Then Operator ships the TTP 
    to the receiving agent, along with the address of the payload on disk. The agent makes an HTTP request back to Operator 
    to retrieve the payload before executing the TTP itself.

answer:
  script: Listen.resolvePayloads("/uploads/hello.txt").filter(p => Encryption.decryptBuffer(fs.readFileSync(p)).toString() == "world").length
  value: 1
