name: Community vs Professional
challenge: Enter a TTP ID that is only available to professional license holders?
context: |
  You may have read about the Community and Professional licenses by now but here's a little bit more information. The
  Community repository is the open-source arm of the Prelude Operator. It contains dozens of free procedures, all ready to
  be used within the platform. These procedures are reloaded everytime you open the app and are accessible within a few
  hours of them being merged into the GitHub repository. These procedures also have tags, which help group them into
  usable collections to build adversary profiles. Operator also has a closed-source collection of procedures
  and tags in the Professional license, which will auto-populate inside your platform if you have a license.

  Community license: |
    The Community repository has dozens of TTPs, organized by ATT&CK tactics. This repository
    gets new additions consistently and contributions are welcomed. Shortly after new TTPs get merged into Community,
    they will appear here, in the desktop application, ready to be used.
  Professional license: |
    If you have a Professional license to Operator, in addition to the TTPs you get in the Community repository your
    Operator instance will be continuously loaded with hundreds of closed-source procedures.
