name: Modify a procedure
challenge: |
  Find the TTP called "1-min sleep" and change one of the executors to sleep for more than 60 seconds.
context: |
  Your Operator checks the Community repo every day for new or updated procedures, downloading them automatically
  into your app. You can make changes yourself to any procedure by editing any adversary. Keep in mind that there is 1 copy of each procedure,
  so if you change it, any adversaries using it will inherit the change. When you make a change manually or there is an
  update to a procedure, you'll see the option to Rest or Update the procedure, which will put it back inline with what is
  in Community.

  Platforms & Executors: |
    Each TTP includes a set of platforms (operating systems) and executors (programs) which the procedure can work on.
    A procedure will usually have a different command for each operating system, despite the goal of it being the same.
    The platform and executors design allows you to model attacks which are "cross-platform", meaning they will work
    regardless of the target operating system.
  Why sleep?: |
    An adversary may choose to sleep for a period of time, to give the impression of inactivity. This is similar to
    playing dead if a bear attacks you. The procedure used in this challenge is one example of how an adversary may
    "play dead" on a computer to avoid detection.
