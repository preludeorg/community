  Script kiddie: |
    In programming and hacking cultures, a script kiddie, skiddie or skid, is an unskilled individual who uses scripts
    or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites.
    It is generally assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs
    or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in
    computer-enthusiast communities. However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant.
  Nation state actor: |
    The Nation State Actor has a 'License to Hack'. They work for a government to disrupt or compromise target
    governments, organizations or individuals to gain access to valuable data or intelligence, and can create incidents
    that have international significance.
