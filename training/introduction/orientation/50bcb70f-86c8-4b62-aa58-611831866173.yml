name: Autonomous hacking
challenge: |
  Fill in the blank: Prelude Operator contains a __ to make decisions while attacking a computer.
context: |
  When a hacker, using their command-and-control (C2) center launches commands against connected (i.e., pwned)
  computers it is known as an attack, or operation. Operator allows you to launch such attacks.
  Furthermore, when an adversary launches an attack with intelligence bundled in, this is known as autonomous hacking.
  Intelligence allows the hacker to leverage automated decision-making to offload the
  normally manual process. This could be for efficiency or speed.

  Automated planning: |
    Automated planning and scheduling, sometimes denoted as AI planning, is a branch of artificial intelligence
    that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents,
    autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles.
  Manual vs Automated Hacking: |
    Penetration testers and red team operators have historically worked in a manual way: they identify their targets,
    determine their context and how to hack them. Then they methodically execute their attack. Automated hacking, like
    Operator, is meant to replace the 80%+ manual work that used to be done manually. Operator brings
    speed, consistency, automatic reporting and a large number of TTPs in a growing knowledge bank. Which is the right
    approach, manual or automated? It depends on your use case but automated should make up the bulk of your security
    posture.
