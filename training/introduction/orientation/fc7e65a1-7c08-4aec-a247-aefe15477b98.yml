name: A common security language
challenge: Fill in the blank. The MITRE __ framework is a classification system used to describe Tactics, Techniques and Procedures.
context: |
  For years, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysts used Indicators of Compromise (IOC) - an IP address, website
  or other objective piece of data - to determine who was attacking them. For example, if they knew the IP address 1.2.3.4
  was owned by the FIN6 hacking group and they saw an attack originating from that address, they could draw the conclusion
  that FIN6 was behind the attack. This was not foolproof however, as IOCs can be spoofed. Behavior-driven attribution, or
  the analysis of what an attacker intrinsically does, emerged as a popular alternative when the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill
  Chain appeared in public. Shortly after that, the MITRE ATT&CK framework became known as the standard behavior-driven
  classification system for its simplicity and comprehensiveness.

  TTP vs Procedure?: |
    Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) is the military term for classifying attacks. In Operator, we use the terms
    TTP and procedure synonymously,
  Indicators of Compromise: |
    An IOC is often described in the forensics world as evidence on a computer that indicates that the security of the
    network has been breached. Investigators usually gather this data after being informed of a suspicious incident,
    on a scheduled basis, or after the discovery of unusual call-outs from the network. An IoC could be an email address,
    IP address, username, website or one of many other objective pieces of data to anchor a finding.
  Cyber Kill Chain: |
    The Cyber Kill Chain is a series of steps which an attacker goes through start to finish during a cyberattack, from
    recon in the beginning to exfiltration of data at the end. The kill chain is intended to organize how an attacker
    conducts their work instead of what they use (tools) to complete it. Lockheed Martin originally developed the kill chain
    from a military model in 2011.
