name: Welcome to Operator training
challenge: Move on to the next flag once you've read the material here.
context: |
  Operator training is designed around the concept of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: each program contains a set
  of flags you must capture in order to complete the material. You should read the material on each flag - but note
  you may need to look around the entire application to capture it. This particular program, Introduction, is designed
  to teach you the nuts and bolts of Operator and how to get bootstrapped. This training program is updated as Operator
  is, so come back frequently to see if there are new flags to capture based on new features being developed. Some 
  Operator training programs - like this one - are ordered, so you must complete challenges in the order they're 
  presented.

    build onboarding and continuous education that is specific to your org.
  Features = Flags: |
    As you progress using Operator, you will see your training percentage go down. This is because the development
    the team here aims to create new flags for all major features. Keep an eye out for new flags to stay up to date!
