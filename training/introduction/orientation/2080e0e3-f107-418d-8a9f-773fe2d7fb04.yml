name: Understanding agents
challenge: In Operator, how many agents can you connect at a single time?
context: |
  When performing a command-and-control attack, you need two parts, a command center (this application) and
  agents running on target systems. Pneuma is the default open-source agent which can connect to the C2 over
  several communication protocols. Headquarters (HQ), the Prelude authentication server, hosts precompiled versions of
  the Pneuma agent for all supported operating systems. You can download these directly to your computer, then move
  them to computers you want to run security assessments on. Pneuma can run on any operating system (Linux, MacOS and
  Windows), requires no administrative privileges and does not need to be installed. Depending on your license,
  the number of maximum agents that can be connected differ. Read more about limits and agent capabilities in the agent docs.

  Remote Access Trojan: |
    A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance, a backdoor for
    administrative control and unfettered and unauthorized remote access to a victim’s machine. The RAT is very dangerous
    because it enables intruders to get remote control of the compromised computer. Attackers can use the exploited
    machines to perform various malicious activities such as installing and removing programs, manipulating files,
    hijacking the webcam, reading data from the keyboard, harvesting login credentials and monitoring the clipboard.
  Living off the land: |
    While malware continues to be a tool often used in the initial intrusion, it is often only the precursor to an
    attack, not the ultimate objective. This initial intrusion is leading to more sophisticated and stealthy techniques,
    such as “living off the land” (LOTL), tradecraft that uses native tools already present on the system to accomplish
    the adversaries’ main objective. LOTL tactics, which do not involve malware, have picked up significantly in the
    world of cyber espionage in recent years.
  Remote Code Execution: |
    Remote code execution (RCE) refers to the ability of a cyberattacker to access and make changes to a computer owned
    by another, without authority and regardless of where the computer is geographically located. RCE can happen through
    nearly any application running on a computer, through a variety of mechanisms, such as injecting code into the
    running application or taking advantage of a security vulnerability within the app. RATs also naturally provide an
    attacker-owned application which opens up RCE on a computer as well, which gives them "ownership" of the machine.
  ThirdEye: |
    Operator includes an agent, ThirdEye, which is built into the application. This agent is written in NodeJS and is
    named after the username of your computer. This agent is great for testing out attacks, as it is built right into
    your application and requires no additional installation steps. Because it is written in NodeJS, ThirdEye is able
    to run commands using the node executor.
