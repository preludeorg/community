name: Create a new procedure
challenge: |
  Create a new TTP and deploy it against one of your connected agents. What is the ID of the TTP you created?
context: |
  One of the unique aspects of Operator is the ability to quickly create your own TTPs and load them in the system.
  By simply creating a new YML file and ensuring the format matches that of other files in the Community repository, you
  are able to add them to Operator. The easiest way to create TTPs is through the Launch Chain sidebar, which will create
  a structured YML file and allow you to just fill in the blanks. In your new TTP, you can create any type of attack 
  you want - just be sure that it is valid YML and it contains at least 1 platform and 1 executor so it can run.

  Choosing a platform & executor: |
    Each TTP requires a platform (operating system) and executor (program the agent uses to run the TTP). There are 3 supported
    platforms in Operator today: windows, linux and darwin (another word for MacOS). By default, each platform can use
    a specific set of executors. Check the documentation around TTPs for a list of options.
