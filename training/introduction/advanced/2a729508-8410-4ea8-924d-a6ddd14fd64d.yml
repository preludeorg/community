challenge: Install the ART plugin to import all Atomic Red Team TTPs.
context: |
  A plugin in Operator is an HTML file, containing valid JavaScript and CSS components. Plugins allow you to extend
  or override various components within Operator, putting you in full control of the system. Cyber security engineers -
  or those who have security and software engineering backgrounds - often want to customize and extend popular open-source
  projects. This can be a time-consuming process and any changes may get wiped out in a future update. Plugins allow a
  safe, easy alternative. Engineers can extend using defined interfaces, allowing them to create extendable components,
  leveraging existing code to quickly iterate on new features. Clicking on a plugin will install it - clicking it again
  will uninstall it.

    which provides numerous TTPs that will be immediately usable in an attack.
