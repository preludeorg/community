name: Understanding plugins
challenge: Load the ART plugin and import the Atomic Red Team attack files.
context: |
  A plugin in Operator is an HTML file, containing valid JavaScript and CSS components. Plugins allow you to extend
  or override various components within Operator, putting you in full control of the system. Cyber security engineers -
  or those who have security and software engineering backgrounds - often want to customize and extend popular open-source
  projects. This can be a time-consuming process and any changes may get wiped out in a future update. Plugins allow a
  safe, easy alternative. Engineers can extend using defined interfaces, allowing them to create extendable components,
  leveraging existing code to quickly iterate on new features. Some plugins are available to community members,
  while others are available to Professional or Enterprise license holders.

  ART plugin: |
    The Atomic Red Team (ART) plugin provides a quick import of all attack files from the popular ART repository.
    Simply clone the popular Red Canary project (https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) and enter your directory
    path in the plugin to convert the files into Operator-format. They will be immediately usable in an attack.
