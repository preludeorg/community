name: A (variant) attack
challenge: |
  Locate the TTP named "Find recent files" and write a variant for your platform that searches your /tmp (or TEMP)
  directory for recently modified files. Then deploy the TTP against your ThirdEye agent.
context: |
  Just as there are numerable procedures for any given ATT&CK technique, each procedure may have variations itself.
  For example, a procedure that does a port scan may look like this: nmap -Pn example.com. This will scan example.com
  for open ports but avoid pinging the host. You may want to include software versions in your port scan, so a variation
  of this command may be: nmap -Pn -sV example.com. Instead of creating a new TTP for each of these variations you can
  outline each variant in a single TTP file. Follow the example formatting in the 'Update agent beacon protocol' TTP.

  name: submit
  data: []

  links: []
hints:
  - Use the search feature in Launch Chain to locate the TTP
  - You may want to search other TTPs to find examples of variants so you can copy the syntax.
  - Note that each variant has its own unique identifier
blocks:
  The /tmp directory: |
    The /tmp (or TEMP) directory on a computer stores temporary files that will be removed automatically by your operating
    system over time or after a reboot. Adversaries will often store malicious code here or use it as a "home base" of 
    sorts because it's an often overlooked directory.
answer:
  script: 
    let attack = Object.values(Attack.a).filter(function (a) {return a.name === 'Find recent files (Modified)'})
    Number(Attack.a[attack[0].id].platforms.darwin.config.variants[0].command.toLowerCase().includes('tmp') || 
    Attack.a[attack[0].id].platforms.linux.config.variants[0].command.toLowerCase().includes ||
    Attack.a[attack[0].id].platforms.windows.config.variants[0].command.toLowerCase().includes('temp'))
