  What is a red team?: |
    A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an 
    enterprise’s security posture. The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of 
    successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (i.e., the Blue Team) in an operational environment. 
    Also known as Cyber Red Team. (NIST, https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/red_team)
  What license should I use?: |
    If you work on a red team you'll want to upgrade your license to Professional once you're comfortable with the Community version. 
    The included TTP subscription will provide you with new attacks and agents every week, so you can lean on our security team for new
    attacks. If you work in a multi-person team, you'll most likely want to upgrade to Enterprise so you can start connecting your individual
    Operator instances together through the Connect plugin. This acts a "team server" environment, allowing your full team to drive the operation
    at the same time.
