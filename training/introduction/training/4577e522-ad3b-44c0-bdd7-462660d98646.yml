  What is a red team?: |
    A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an 
    enterprise’s security posture. The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of 
    successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (i.e., the Blue Team) in an operational environment.
