  What is InfoSec?: |
    Information Security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. 
    It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate 
    access to data, or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or 
    devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents.
