context: |
  Training is broken into Programs -> Courses -> Challenges. A program is like a never-ending school degree. Operator
  takes on you a continuous-learning journey aimed at keeping your skills up to date. There are multiple programs available,
  starting with a free Introduction program, teaching you how to get the most out of your Operator instance. Within each
  programs are courses. Similar to being in school, an Operator course is a subset of the overall program, aimed at
  teaching you a specific area. Within each course are challenges. A challenge is like a pop quiz, complete with hints,
  supplemental information and more. Please click on the informational blocks within each challenge (see below) for
  supplemental information. What you read in these blocks will help you later in this program!

  Click the grey dots!: |
    Every time you load a course, you'll automatically be presented with the next challenge
    to complete (until you've done them all and are ready to move on to another course or program).
    But if you look at the bottom right of most sections, you'll see a series of grey dots
    allowing you to complete challenges within the section they apply. These are the same challenges you'll find
    here in the Introduction courses - but they're available within their respective sections so you can do them
    without hopping back and forth to the training section.

  Features = Flags: |
