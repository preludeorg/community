name: Run your first operation
challenge: |
  Can you deploy a chain against your ThirdEye agent? Enter the link ID of any completed TTP.
context: |
  Operator is a command-and-control (C2) platform that allows you to run threat assessments against any
  computer - or range of computers. This process is known as red teaming and it is the backbone of advanced
  cybersecurity. With a little bit of training, the red team process can also be executed by those on the defensive
  side (blue teamers) or those working in Information Technology and Security (InfoSec). Operator includes
  training to teach technical professionals how to do this. Complete this Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge to get
  started. Use the extra info below for pointers and the resources for extended learning.

    TTPs can include malware: https://attack.mitre.org/software
    Chain = Group: https://attack.mitre.org/groups
hints:
  - Did you create a chain and add at least 1 TTP?
  - Make sure at least one TTP is completed. You should see the result on the agent dashboard.
  - You will find the link ID when you click on a completed TTP (row) in the agent dashboard.
  - You should be looking for a UUID-4
blocks:
  What is a TTP?: |
    TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, which is a military term used to describe different strategies
    of an operation. In red teaming, a TTP is used as shorthand to describe a single micro-attack, sometimes referred
    simply as a procedure. All TTPs inside Operator are safe to run by default. The ones that could
    create an unintended effect on your computer are marked as "destructive" and require you to enable them before use.
  What is a chain?: |
    A chain is a collection of TTPs. Sometimes a chain is designed to emulate a known Advanced Persistent
    Threat (APT) group. Other times, a chain is simply an organized set of TTPs.
  What is an agent?: |
    An agent, otherwise known as a Remote Access Trojan, is a piece of malicious software running on a target computer.
    The agent is responsible for executing an adversary's instructions - or TTPs. Operator includes a safe built-in
    agent known as ThirdEye. ThirdEye will appear in your home computer range and will be labeled as the host name of your
    computer.
  What is an operation: |
    In Operator lingo, an operation is a full execution of a chain. When you click "Deploy" on a chain, when
    it completes, so does the operation.
  Understanding a link ID: |
    We like to think of each chain as containing a set of potential TTPs to run. And when each one completes we
    refer to it as a link. Each link is given a unique identifier which you will see next to the output of the TTP itself.
answer:
  script: |
    Agent.a.filter(function(a) {
        let links = a.links.filter(function(l) {
            return l.ttp.toLowerCase() === $('#answer').val().toLowerCase()
        })
        return links.length > 0
    }).length
