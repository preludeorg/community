name: Defining chains
challenge: |
  There were several high-profile ransomware attacks in 2021. We wrote chains to emulate 
  several of them. Enter the name of one.
context: |
  There are many nuanced terms in cybersecurity, often overlapping with others. It can be tough to keep track
  of them all. Inside Operator, we try to use as few custom terms as possible and try to over-explain terminology
  wherever possible to make it easier to onboard and make sense of an already complex industry. Two terms come
  up often in the app: adversary and chain, so let's look at them a little closer. The term chain was originally used
  in the CALDERA framework to describe a subset of an attacker's overall operation. A chain includes n-number of
  individual TTPs, which work together to achieve some type of output. The term adversary is a common cybersecurity term, 
  often referring to the attacker overall. An adversary in the real-world may know how to execute dozens of chained attacks. 
  We emulate this by allowing you to pick a prebuilt chain and then append more TTPs to it.

  CALDERA: |
    The CALDERA framework is an open-source C2 framework, supported by The MITRE Corporation, to conduct research in 
    autonomous, adversarial decision-making. Fun fact: the core developers of CALDERA version 2+ also built the Operator platform.
  An example chain: |
    We often highlight the "File Hunter" chain in Operator demonstrations because it's a cross-platform chain that highlights the
    concept well. In this chain, the included TTPs will locate recently-modified files, create a staging directory, copy the found
    files into the directory, compress the directory, and finally exfiltrate the compressed file back to Operator.
  TTP Tuesday: |
    Every week, the Prelude security team publishes a new chain. The chain will have a handful of TTPs and will automatically load into
    Operator, available to Professional license holders. You can read about each chain on our site: https://chains.prelude.org.
