challenge: Can you find the "man pages" on following TTP 'Collect ARP details'?
context: |
  Blue teams should use Operator to test their ability to detect common attacks. Purple teams 
  can accelerate this process through advanced adversary development and automation support. To
  help you achieve the following tasks, we provide in-depth documentation on build in TTPs. Within
  the reference manual pages you will find a TTPs context, output, use, and known detection and 
  preventation information. Once you find and read the desired documentation come back and verify the
  flag.

  What is a blue team?: |
    The group responsible for defending an enterprise’s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of 
    mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically the Blue Team and its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks 1) 
    over a significant period of time, 2) in a representative operational context (e.g., as part of an operational exercise), and 3) 
    according to rules established and monitored with the help of a neutral group refereeing the simulation or exercise.
    (NIST, https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/blue_team).
  What is a purple team?: |
    Purple Teams exist to ensure and maximize the effectiveness of the Red and Blue teams. They do this by integrating 
    the defensive tactics and controls from the Blue Team with the threats and vulnerabilities found by the Red Team into 
    a single narrative that maximizes both. Ideally Purple shouldn’t be a team at all, but rather a permanent dynamic between 
    Red and Blue (https://danielmiessler.com/study/red-blue-purple-teams/).
