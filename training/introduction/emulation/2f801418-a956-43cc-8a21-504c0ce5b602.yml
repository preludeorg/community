name: Reverse-shell interaction
challenge: Can you open a reverse-shell to any Pneuma agent connected over TCP?
context: To establish a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to a remote network host
  and requests a shell session â€“ this is called a bind shell. But what if the remote host is not directly accessible,
  for example because it has no public IP or is protected by a firewall? In this situation, a reverse shell might be
  used, where the target machine initiates an outgoing connection to a listening network host and a shell session is
  established. Reverse shells are often the only way to perform remote maintenance on hosts behind a NAT, so they have
  legitimate administrative uses. However, they can also be used by cybercriminals to execute operating system commands
  on hosts protected from incoming connections by a firewall or other network security systems.

blocks:
  Meterpreter (Metasploit): |
    Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that provides an interactive shell from which an attacker can explore
    the target machine and execute code. Meterpreter is deployed using in-memory DLL injection. As a result,
    Meterpreter resides entirely in memory and writes nothing to disk. Metasploit is one of the most popular
    command-and-control (C2) frameworks on the 'net but is also one of the most signatured, meaning it is tricky to
    use successfully with today's defenses. You are likely to run across the Meterpreter agent in the future but for
    now, think of it as the Metasploit version of the Pneuma agent.
  Beacon (Cobalt Strike): |
    Beacon is Cobalt Strike's agent to model advanced attackers. Use Beacon to egress a network over HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS.
