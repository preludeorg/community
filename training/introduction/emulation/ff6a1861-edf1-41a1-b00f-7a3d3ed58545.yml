name: Serve on all interfaces
challenge: Can you ensure this desktop app is being served on all IPv4 interfaces?
context: |
  A network interface is the point of interconnection between a computer and a private or public network. A network
  interface is generally a network interface card (NIC), but does not have to have a physical form.
  Instead, the network interface can be implemented in software. By default, Prelude serves the desktop application
  only on localhost, which means the listening posts (tcp/udp/http) can only be accessed by processes on the computer
  itself. By serving on all interfaces, Prelude Operator is able to accept connections from other computers. This is a
  requirement if you plan on running agents on computers that are different from the one running this application.

blocks:
  0.0.0.0: |
    0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown or non applicable target (a no
    particular address placeholder). In the context of a route entry, it usually means the default route. In the
    context of servers, 0.0.0.0 means "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine".
  127.0.0.1: |
    The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special-purpose IPv4 address and is called the localhost or loopback address.
    All computers use this address as their own, but it doesn't let computers communicate with other devices as a real
    IP address does.

  script: Settings.settings.local.server
  value: 0.0.0.0
