name: Port check
challenge: Which port is being used as the default TCP listening post?
context: Prelude Operator serves several listening posts on the computer where it is running. A listening post is simply an
  open port which accepts traffic over a specific protocol. Listening posts are the connection points that remote
  access trojans use to talk to the command-and-control center. TCP is one of the most popular
  connection-based protocols and as such, Operator opens a port for this protocol. Aside from TCP, the app
  also opens up UDP and HTTP ports for agents to communicate over.

  TCP/IP: |
    TCP/IP, or the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols used to
    interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private
    computer network (an intranet or an extranet). The entire Internet Protocol suite -- a set of rules and procedures
    -- is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP and IP are the two main protocols, though others are included in the suite.
    The TCP/IP protocol suite functions as an abstraction layer between internet applications and the routing/switching
    fabric.
  UDP: |
    In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite.
    The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980.
    UDP is a stateless connection protocol, which means that it is incapable of maintaining two-way
    communications with an endpoint (like TCP). UDP is useful in communications where it is acceptable to lose some of the
    messages in transit. Services like video conferencing and routers often use UDP. Prelude Operator serves a single UDP
    listening post, so agents can send in beacons. The pneuma agent can send beacons into this post, which serve as
    heart-beat messages (indications that the agent is still alive). At this time however, the pneuma agent cannot
    receive messages back (the pong to the ping) through the UDP listening post.
  HTTP: |
    HTTP is simply the name of the most popular protocol for communicating on the web, and browsers mostly talk via
    HTTP when communicating with servers. An HTTP exchange involves the client (our browser) sending a request, and the
    server replying back with a response.
