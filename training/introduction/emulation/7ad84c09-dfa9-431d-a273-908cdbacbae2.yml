name: Get to know Pneuma
challenge: Can you deploy 3 instances of Pneuma simultaneously, using HTTP, TCP, and UDP?
context: |
  The Pneuma agent is a multi-purpose agent which is written to be a full example of how you can build your own agents.
  Without building your own, you can still use Pneuma to run highly effective red team assessments. Written in GoLang,
  Pneuma supports all major operating systems and has a built-in TCP connector, meaning it can open up a persistent
  connection between itself and Operator. TCP is the default protocol used by Pneuma, and is arguably the most common
  protocol used by adversaries in the wild. Through TCP, Pneuma can do two things: allow a user to open reverse shells
  to itself and allow an attacker to launch blazing-fast autonomous hacks. Aside from TCP, Pneuma offers the ability
  to connect to Operator over HTTP, and UDP.

hints:
  - Have you downloaded the Pneuma agent from the Agent Library plugin?
  - From a terminal, run the agent with the -help flag to see the options
  - You will need to change the contact and address parameters for non-TCP agents
  - The HTTP contact requires "http" to be part of the address

  Remote Access Trojan: |
    A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows covert surveillance, a backdoor for
    administrative control and unfettered and unauthorized remote access to a victimâ€™s machine. The RAT is very dangerous
    because it enables intruders to get remote control of the compromised computer. Attackers can use the exploited
    machines to perform various malicious activities such as installing and removing programs, manipulating files,
    hijacking the webcam, reading data from the keyboard, harvesting login credentials and monitoring the clipboard.
  Download Pneuma: |
    There are two ways you can download Pneuma. The Agent Library plugin within this app (easy) and compiling your
    own agent from the GitHub source code (medium).
  Name your agent: |
    It is possible to pass values from the command line to Pneuma when it is started. These values are called
    command line arguments and may be needed if you are switching contact points or other parameters. You can
    view the optional arguments by passing -help to the agent when running it. One argument you can pass will give your
    agent a custom name. If you don't use this, Pneuma will create a random name for you. Note: you can only have 1 agent in
    Operator with a given name.
  HTTP explained: |
    One of recent trends in command-and-control operations is to hide C2 behind HTTP/HTTPS. Because most
    computers do a heavy amount of network requests, both to the internet and locally, it is easy to hide in the
    traffic. Attackers will often model their C2 over HTTP to look like a typical API, so it will blend in with all of
    the desktop applications and other programs using APIs.
answer:
  script: |
    function aPlatforms(a){ return a.platform; }
    function aProtocols(a){ return a.handler.name; }
    let online = Agent.agents.filter(a => a.state === Agent.StateEnum.online);
    let platforms = new Set(online.map(aPlatforms));
    let protocols = new Set(online.map(aProtocols));
    Number(online.length >= 3 && protocols.size >= 3);
  value: 1
