name: Human in the loop
challenge: |
   Can you lock an agent, deploy an adversary and enter the name of a procedure that is pending your approval?
context: |
  Operator's dock provides a wealth of opportunities and capability. One of these examples is the ability to design
  complex attacks using a wide range of accessible TTPs and agent compatibility.
  In cyber warfare, each attack has a purpose and a goal in mind. When paired with the agent locking functionality, an
  operation's flexibility is expanded. Locking an agent allows the user to accept or reject procedures
  on an individual basis, allowing the operator to inject themselves into the decision-making process. You would use this
  feature if you want full control over every command that is sent to the agent.

  Human-in-the-loop: |
    Human-in-the-loop is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates machine learning models by combining
    human and machine intelligence. People are involved in a virtuous circle where they train, tune, and test a particular
    algorithm in a classic human-in-the-loop technique. To begin, humans assign labels to data. This provides a model
    with a large quantity of high-quality training data from which a machine learning system can use to learn to make decisions.
    The model is then fine-tuned by humans. This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most typical is for humans to assess
    data to correct for overfitting, teach a classifier about edge cases, or add new categories to the model's scope.
    Finally, users can score a model's outputs to test and validate it, especially in cases where an algorithm is unsure
    about a judgment or overconfident about an inaccurate choice.
  Phases of a Red Team: |
    There are operations in a 'cyber killchain' that include both pre- and post- compromise phases which follow a methodology.
    Both Recon and Initial Access are common steps in the pre-compromise phase. Discovery, Persistence, Movement, PrivEsc, Exfiltration,
    and Reports are all part of the post-compromise phase. Each stage has a specific goal that must be completed in order
    to continue the attack. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a general guideline for strike strategy.

  script: |
    Number(Agent.agents.filter(function (a) { return a.locked && a.queue.filter(i => i.attack.name.toLowerCase() === $('#answer').val().toLowerCase()).length > 0 }).length > 0)
