name: Agent states
challenge: |
  Can you lock an agent, deploy a chain against it and enter the name of a procedure that is pending your approval?
context: |
  An agent can be in a variety of states: autonomous, locked or simulated. A locked agent requires you, the human,
  to approve or discard each instruction before it is sent to the agent. If autonomous (the default) the instructions are
  sent automatically. An agent in a simulated state will never receive instructions - instead Operator will simulate 
  realistic responses so you can see what might happen if you were to send a particular chain to a particular agent.

  data: []

hints:
  - You can change an agent's mode from their Config sidebar.
  - Did you deploy a chain against the locked agent?
  - After deploying a chain, check the agent's queue.

  Human-in-the-loop: |
    Human-in-the-loop is a branch of artificial intelligence that creates machine learning models by combining
    human and machine intelligence. People are involved in a virtuous circle where they train, tune, and test a particular
    algorithm in a classic human-in-the-loop technique. To begin, humans assign labels to data. This provides a model
    with a large quantity of high-quality training data from which a machine learning system can use to learn to make decisions.
    The model is then fine-tuned by humans. This can happen in a variety of ways, but the most typical is for humans to assess
    data to correct for overfitting, teach a classifier about edge cases, or add new categories to the model's scope.
    Finally, users can score a model's outputs to test and validate it, especially in cases where an algorithm is unsure
    about a judgment or overconfident about an inaccurate choice.
  Phases of a Red Team: |
    There are operations in a 'cyber killchain' that include both pre- and post- compromise phases which follow a methodology.
    Both Recon and Initial Access are common steps in the pre-compromise phase. Discovery, Persistence, Movement, PrivEsc, Exfiltration,
    and Reports are all part of the post-compromise phase. Each stage has a specific goal that must be completed in order
    to continue the attack. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a general guideline for strike strategy.
