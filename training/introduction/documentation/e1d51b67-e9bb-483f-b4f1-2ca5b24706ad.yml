name: Fully. Autonomous. Security.
challenge: What Prelude tool offers fully autonomous red teaming?
context: |
  Operator is a fully autonomous red team platform, allowing you to install and forget it like an antivirus. Of course,
  if you have the time and skills you can also use Operator as a manual security tool. There are several human-in-the-loop
  capabilities (outlined below) which allow for varying levels of manual control. If you want to go fully autonomous however,
  you'll want to install __. This tool will select a chain on a
  random time schedule (usually once per week). A chain is a focused hack which would be a single component
  within a larger attack. Chains will only run safe attacks - so no damage will occur to your computer. Instead,
  you'll experience a safe continuous adversarial attack to see how you and your technology would react in the real world.
  This tool is aimed at training users at how to behave better while on their computers, encouraging them to be more
  aware of what a cyber attack looks like.

  Scheduling: |
    If you don't want to rely on the randomly selected chains, you can build your own custom chain
    and schedule it at any interval you want over the Operator API.
  Agent locking: |
    If you aren't ready to go fully autonomous, look for the lock icon on each agent. Clicking this will queue all attacks
    for the agent until you are able to approve them.
  Editor mode (advanced): |
    If you work on an existing security team, you may want to build your own attacks (TTPs). The Editor section allows you
    to hop into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for building individual TTPs. Here, you can also edit and manipulate
    any existing TTPs. This is meant to be your database of attacks.
  Reverse shell: |
    Go fully human-in-the-loop by opening a reverse-shell to any TCP-connected agent. This allows you to run any arbitrary
    shell command.
