name: Create a new payload
challenge: |
  Can you create a new payload? It should be named "hello.txt" and its contents should be "world". You can attach it
  to any TTP you like.
context: |
  Payloads are an essential part of a red team operation. They are separate binaries, often containing extensive logic, and can be thought of as 
  malware. A payload can be written in any computer language and is commonly compiled into a single executable file or designed to 
  be loaded into memory (to avoid detection). Inside Operator, you can attach a payload to any TTP and add instructions for executing it. 
  Instead of writing TTPs which contain dozens or hundreds of lines of instructions, consider putting that code into a payload and writing
  a simple TTP which can execute the payload file.

  How Payloads Work: |
    Each TTP can offload part of its execution to an external attachment that will get automatically downloaded
    before the TTP runs. The payload will be downloaded to whatever directory the agent is running from on the target.
answer:
  script: Listen.resolvePayloads("/uploads/hello.txt").filter(p => Encryption.decryptBuffer(fs.readFileSync(p)).toString() == "world").length
