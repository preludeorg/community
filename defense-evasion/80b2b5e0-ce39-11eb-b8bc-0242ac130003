name: create Alternate Data Streams to hide malware or other data to avoid detection
description: |
  Alternate Data Streams of "C:\\*:zone.identifier*" are normal occurrences. However, alternate data streams for files can be created to hide executables. 
  enigma0x3 details an example where nc.exe (netcat) is written to an alternate data stream for calc.exe.
